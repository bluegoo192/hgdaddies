I've been there twice hoping that a re-return would change my original opinion.  The first time I was there was on a Saturday, early afternoon in Spring.

I saw a lot of nice 1960s furniture, mostly living room sets and home decor.  Prices were on the high end for, let's face it folks, used furniture. The blonde lady who came out to greet me after I made it to their second room (there are 3 rooms total) was frazzled and preoccupied with eating her lunch. So I went back again last week.  Didn't see the frazzled lady from before but a mid-age hipster guy at the counter who didn't have the time to greet me (sorry I disrupted your cell phone surfing).  Yep.  I was the ONLY person in the store and you obviously ignored me.  \n\nIt's just an unwelcoming place.  So much potential, but the attitude there is less than acceptable.

My boyfriend and I went along with my parents (who love mid century modern furniture) just to look as I am moving soon and can't buy any furniture until I relocate, but this shop made me want to move to downtown Phoenix and fill my house with everything in this shop. My thrift-genius parents taught me to buy antique furniture and never ever ever buy new, as new furniture is expensive to buy and cheaply made. Modern on Melrose is fantastic proof of this - my boyfriend fell in love with a yellow leather and wood 70s couch and noticed that this beautiful couch cost less than a couch our friend recently bought at IKEA. And no one is going to buy IKEA couches in antique stores 40 years from now, because they barely last 1 move. \n\nEverything in this store is gorgeous and there is a great variety of furniture and random decor goods. We ended up buying some great stacking canisters as a gift, and the very helpful employee dashed back to the area we got them and told us they were 40% off. We debated keeping the canisters because they were as affordable as they were quirky and useful and interestingly designed, but the Christmas spirit prevailed and we decided to give them to their original recipient.\n\nThe same employee discussed style and furniture things with my father in a very helpful and absolutely non pretentious way, which is a refreshing and fun element of any antique store. I always want to talk to the employees but very often feel they are too busy or want to sound smarter than me (which they are, but I'm not buying anything if the person I'm giving money to makes me feel stupid). I was very struck by how open and helpful the employee was. Great experience. Great selection. Great prices.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I was very much looking forward to going to Modern on Melrose as my sister had raved about the selection and several purchases she recently made here. I was all set to help her select more furniture for her new home until I experienced a combination of disbelief, shock and horror. \n\nI was inside the store when I heard a man loudly say \"If you're going to start a sale, finish it!\" It took a few more seconds of loud voices before I realized an argument was taking place between two employees and not two customers, as I initially thought. The male and female employee continued to loudly argue, back and forth. Feeling very uncomfortable, I started to look for my sister. There were about four other customers and we all ended up outside as we all felt very uncomfortable in the store. \n\nAs I was walking out of the store to go out back, I heard the male employee say, in a tone that was beyond anger but instead violent, \"Don't you ever tell me to shut up! Ever!\" Shortly after, he walked past all 5 female customers, who had gathered out back, turned to us and angrily said \"Bitch!\" Not knowing what he was going to do when he returned, we decided to leave as we did not feel safe. \n\nIt is one thing to feel uncomfortable, it is completely unacceptable to not feel safe. The interaction between the two employees was the most unprofessional thing I have ever witnessed. The male and female employee were so caught up in their own negative interaction, neither of them offered any customer service. And after their argument ended, the female employee offered no apologies and still no customer service. \n\nToday was my first and last time in Modern on Melrose. How terribly sad for this store. I sincerely hope the owners get a handle on this and educate their employees as to what it and isn't acceptable behavior.","useful":4,"funny":3,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Cynthia actually asked me if I wanted to take some time to consider my purchase (not pushy at all!) and I told her I loved everything and I wanted to take delivery as soon as possible.\n\nI then asked Cynthia to help me find a pair of lamps for the bed side tables I purchased. This time around I wasn't really loving anything but she took the time again to show me around and listen to my input. \n\nAnother reviewer mentioned that their pieces are pricy and that could not be further from the truth.

The barkeep was friendly and chatted us up while we sat and watched an NBA game. \n\nWe were so pleased with the service and food (spicy tuna roll -- YUM) that we decided to come back a couple hours later for dinner.\n\nThe dining area is upstairs.  Getting up there is quite a sight - floor to ceiling gold drawers. Pretty impressive.  Once seated (inside) we quickly realized we should have sat on the patio.  The inside of the restaurant was dark.  Not mood-making-romantic dark.  More like push-that-candle-here-so-I-can-read-the-menu dark. Oh well.\n\nWe ordered a couple entrees (pad thai and singapore style noodles) and a Tom Yum soup.  The soup was super tasty and chocked full of amazingly tender chicken.  My one gripe about the soup...there were pieces of fried scallion (or something...I couldn't really see what it was) that was really fiberous and unpleasant to eat.  I ended up picking it out of my soup.\n\nThe pad thai was to die for. Super tasty and a really great portion.  I did raise an eyebrow at the price ($15) - but hey, it's Vegas baby.  My fella loved the singapore style noodles.  He would have licked the plate clean if he wasn't so classy.\n\nWe enjoyed a two-for-one cocktail with our complimentary voucher from Treasure Island and both opted for the ginger mojito.

We had four different servers at one point and before any of them could get to our table to take our order, the barkeep came by since we had been sitting (unattended to) for about twenty minutes.

Luckily for us, this only took about 15 minutes, in which we had enough time to sample some of their tasty sake.\n\nOur chef was absolutely hilarious! He had a sort of Bruce Lee trying to do a joke type of humour and was a magician with his utensils. My colleague went for the scallops, while I opted for the filet mignon. Both were very tasty but the chef mentioned that I should try the samurai steak next time, as it's his personal favourite (he let me have a little bite and it was delicious).\n\nHalf way through the dinner, he asked us if anyone was celebrating anything special.

This never used to be a problem, but lately when I have gone it has been.  However, after a few Dirty Dog IPA's, this is easily forgiven.  \n\nTry the cheese curds, and the philly cheese steak sandwich.  The fries are awesome too.  Overall, this smaller version of the Draft House has the best beer brewed in Las Vegas (at their Rancho location), and pretty darn good bar food.  This is a regular hang out for me and my coworkers.","useful":7,"funny":4,"cool":5,"type":"review"}

I tried the 38 special which is a blend of two different beers. It was smooth and enjoyable. \n\nPair any of these cold drafts with one of their monster burgers and satisfaction is sure to ensue. I got the Tex-Mex; a thick burger topped with a grilled green pepper, cheese, bacon, crispy sweet onion straws, and a BBQ sauce. With a side of their sweet potato fries for an additional $1 hit the spot. Although the fries were cold, the burger more than made up for it. My friend ordered the Big Dog burger and something else came out. In the end, we split both burgers to help alleviate his disappointment. Instead, we were both very happy.

Obviously, as a vegetarian, a place like this doesn't provide a whole lot of options, so I went with a couple apps. My brother, a meat eater extraordinaire had the pulled pork sandwich. My apps were pretty gross deep fried average bar food. My brother wasn't happy with the very gristly pulled pork. The highlight for me was the beer.

The food was mostly great, the service very lacking (e.g.,hree requests to the waitress for water???).\n\nI ordered a Tuscan chicken sandwich on foccacia, which came with roasted peppers, mozzarella, and yum, sauteed spinach and garlic.  It would have been outstanding if they'd only heated the foccacia to crisp it up.  Instead of the fries or cole slaw, I sprang for the extra two bucks to change it up for a salad.  I expected a tiny side salad, but this was really big, with lots of chopped tomatoes, cuke, cheese, and romaine.  It was missing olives, but that was great:  I hate olives!  By the time I got halfway through the salad, I felt like I'd already eaten dinner.\n\nMy husband ordered the walleye special.  I thought it was pretty high-priced at $20, but it came with the aforementioned salad, plus two sides. But when they brought out the plate, I saw the reason for the high price: the piece of fish was absolutely monstrous.  It could have fed a small third-world nation, but my husband lives to eat, so he managed to devour half of it before throwing in the towel.  It became my dinner on Saturday night, and I thought it was fabulous!  I also appreciated the fact that it wasn't over-salted.

The servers at this particular location are TERRIBLE though. The first time I went here, my sister and I stood at the host stand for more than 10 minutes waiting for someone to sit us in the dining area. They weren't even remotely busy. Had a few of them walk by us and didn't do anything. Finally someone seats us, but we still waited forever for someone to come take our order. Once that happens we are again finding ourselves waiting and waiting and waiting. Almost 20 minutes later they come and tell us they hadn't put the ticket in (didn't say anything during the long wait because I already figured the service was going to be slow) So she offers to buy our appetizer and finally has our order in. I decided to go there again with my sister and a friend,  because it's close and like I said, the food is awesome. The wait at the host stand wasn't long this time but the wait for food and ordering were still slow. The server brought us the check and I asked her to split it for us, sounds easy enough.

I enjoy watching the Sunday night football game here and enjoying a drink or two.  Last night I decided to grab a bite to eat.\n\nI was dining by myself and wanted some finger food.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided to go with the Nachos ($10.50).  To wash it down, I had an Iced Tea.\n\nI watched the Giants\/Bears game while I waited for my grub......it didn't take too long before it came....the waitress delivered the Nachos and they were a friggin' mountain of Nachos!  (see pics) Seriously.....I'm not opposed to large portions, but damn this thing could easily feed 4 people!  I was a little pissed because I didn't want to eat that much and the waitress didn't say anything.....also the menu didn't mention the gargantuan size of the Nachos either.  I reacted by saying \"Damn, that's a friggin' mountain of food!\".....she replied \"I know\"......well if you knew, why didn't you say something when I ordered it?!\n\nThis is where I am torn....do I knock off a Star because of this?  or not?  I personally feel that it's the server's responsibility to inform customers of stuff like this....especially when they see someone is dining alone and portion size is not mentioned on the menu.\n\nBack to the food....the Nachos were topped with melted Cheddar Cheese, Jalapenos, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Onions, Olives, Tomatoes.  The thing was so massive that stuff was falling off the edges of plate....another faux pas from the server is that she didn't offer me a smaller plate to eat my Nachos.....she expected me to pull pieces off this mountain and have it fall all over the table like a pig.  I tried for a few minutes but felt like a slob so I asked her for a plate, which she brought over right away.\n\nThe Nachos flavor wasn't spectacular, it was bleh.  The Cheese wasn't gooey....it was melted, but seemed to be sitting a little while because it was already coagulating and it was difficult to eat the Nachos without using a fork.  Also, it was top heavy with the toppings....meaning after the 1st layer of Nachos, there was nothing but bare chips in the lower sections.  What's the point of this dish then?  I don't know.....I felt bad because I didn't even come close to finishing it and it wasn't worth taking home......what a waste of food.\n\nI took off 1 Star because of the bad service.....still a great place to catch a game.  I've eaten here many times in the past with great experiences, but was an inactive Yelper at the time so those experiences are outdated.\n\nWill I return?  Because of my favorable history with Big Dog's, I will give them another chance.....next time I'm asking the server how large the portion is.","useful":10,"funny":5,"cool":6,"type":"review"}

Well drinks were $3.25 - not a bad price - but do I give the barkeep a less-than-a-buck tip (hate to do that) or end up with a purse full of quarters (hate that a little more)?

Typically, Indian restaurants dry the crap out of their chicken when they put it in the tandoor, and this is the strongest point in favour of this restaurant getting 4 stars.\n\nThe ambiance is where it looses a bit of cache for me.  There was a sort of awkward white guy playing a sitar in front of what must be the lunch-time buffet station.  There was just something about that scenario that screamed \"We're throwing the South Asian kitchen sink at you, what more could you want?

I liked the paintings of Nepal on the walls as well as the post cards near the door. They've clearly put in effort to make the place not look as tacky as the proverbial south asian restaurant, and for that I commend them. \n\nThe food is not bad per se, but it's pretty generic and forgettable. The Nepali portion of the menu is limited, and unfortunately the differences between the Indian and Nepali dishes were very minimal, for eg,: our server told us that the only difference between Bhuteko Cauli (Nepali Entree) and Aloo Ghobi (Indian Entree) was that the latter had potatoes in it! I understand that Nepali dishes aren't that different but to make the dishes taste the same is a bit ridiculous. They think that since no single table is going to order both the Nepali and Indian equivalents together, they can get away with making cosmetic changes to their dishes.\n\nWe ordered  Keema Samosas,  and the Nepalese Entrees: Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, lentils and bamboo shoots) and Khasi Ko Masu (goat meat with bone) and Ras Malai for dessert. The food was freshly prepared and piping hot. The Aloo Tama Bodi was quite bland and the Goat Meat curry tasted like generic Indian  goat curry. I was quite interested in the Aloo Tama Bodi primarily for the bamboo shoots and was saddened to see limp, noodl-y shoots in the bowl. Oh well. However, the Ras Malai was very good: delicately sweet, milky and cool.\n\nThe service was good except that they mixed up our order, but that was corrected in a jiffy.\n\nDinner for two came to about $ 52 with tip and tax. Pretty expensive for a very middling experience.  I'd have liked them to put more effort in their food than their decor.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Butter Chicken: Delivery quantity was very small when compared to the actual dine-in quantity. The chicken tasted as if it was just put into the butter chicken gravy and served. We wouldn't have cared much if only the gravy tasted good. Being an Indian, I can easily differentiate good butter chicken from the rest. Unfortunately, this wasn't the best I have had in Toronto. \n\n3 out 5 stars.\n\n2. Naan: The Naan was a horror story. It wasn't cooked well. I could taste the raw flour which made them inedible for us. Apart from that, the naan smelled very bad. \n\n0 out 5 stars.\n\nWe had to throw out the naan and ate the butter chicken with bread. Totally ruined the evening for us.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

This restaurant has the most horrible customer service that you can imagine. Me and a friend went over in the early part of the evening and resto was already pretty crowded. One of the servers sat us down at a 'waiting' table in the front and said the table would be ready in about 20 minutes. He put down a couple of poppadums and then vanished. 35 minutes went by, the waiting area was getting pretty crowded. We were getting antsy by now. My friend went and found the guy and asked him for an update 'only 5 minutes sir!' OK..another 15 went by..my friend went again to look for the sever who (guess what) took one look at him and ran inside!! Meanwhile, even those waiting after of us were seated. We managed to find the floor manager who looked surprised that we'd been waiting for 1 hour plus. I had enough and said- look, either we sit asap or we can leave, to which he replied - not possible today...human error... I'd be happy to serve you another day...we waited for him to add the words 'on the house' or at least a measly 'at a discount' but NO! nothing...he just looked at us blankly. We left the resto hungry, tired and with a resolve to tell other foodies like us about how LITTLE THEY CARE FOR THE CUSTOMER!!

Im not a fan of super hot - I much prefer deep rich flavour. We were assured that medium would be the right selection (mild - too bland, and hot would have too much heat). They were right. The medium was perfect - deep rich flavours and just a hint of warmth which is perfect on a cold day.\n\nThe food itself was cooked to perfection. The lamb was cooked enough to be \"cooked\" but still melt in your mouth soft.   Aloo tami bodi was a potato dish with bamboo and black-eyed peas in a rich yummy sauce. The momos came with a lentil mustard sauce that my companion ate with a spoon (it was that good).\n\nEven with many alcoholic drinks the final tally was quite inexpensive!

Malai Kofta (Cottage Cheese with vegetables in a cashew sauce)\n\nThe dishes were both tasty! I really enjoyed the Aloo Tama Bodi's flavour, and the Malai Kofta was also delicious.\n\nAdditionally, I was happy with the amount of Naan and rice we received in a single order. There was more than enough to cover both dishes. The ratio of bread or rice needed to cover a dish at Mt Everest is clearly 1:1.\n\nWhich brings me to why my review is only 2 star. The portions! First of all, the Malai Kofta only came with about 3 small cubes of cheese. Both dishes came in small, unfilled containers (sadly Instagram deleted our photo evidence) and compared to Indian portions elsewhere (and the price) we were disappointed. \n\nFlavour-wise, I actually would recommend.

A restaurant can't rely soley on the food.\n\nLocated on the northern side of Bell Road in a newer strip mall the outside looks very inviting.  As you walk in the decor is neatly situated and the atmosphere gets you excited for some possible good mexican food.  After your initial look around when walking in a little confusion may settle in. No one will greet you at the door and you wonder if you should wait to be sat or just seat yourself.  With more observation you'll notice a sign far away from the front door saying \"Please seat yourself.\"  \n\nSo you look for a clean cozy table and seat yourself, which is not a big deal at all.  Next you have to wait for someone to give you a menu to see what they actually serve.  You would think that menus would arrive very shortly, but I found out that on two occasions it took upwards to five minutes for them to arrive.  I am an understanding person , I can see the place is busy,and I love mexican food so I patiently wait with a smile.\n\nI could go and on about how long it took for my experiences here.  What I found out on two lunch visits that the owners are the servers as well.  No problem at all with this if you are good at what you do and are speedy.  However when each server has over a ten table section and can't get you in and out in a timely manner then it's time to hire some help.  Or maybe change your concept of the restaurant while having customers go to a window and order their food.\n\nI'll remind you that the food is really good, but everything takes forever.  My recommendation is to try takeout.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

This is Halisco style food - not the same! Think of it as more of a gourmet style Mexican restaurant. And b) they ordered the chicken tacos. Admittedly, they sort of suck. I've been coming here with my family for years! After they moved across town to the new location, we followed.\n\nAmbiance: It's a CUTE restaurant with an old town Mexican theme. Subdued lighting with eccentric and rich coloring.\n\nService: You are evil spawn if you don't like M&M. They work hard and are the loveliest people ever! They are friendly and remember you if you go there often enough. He looks angry but I swear he's super nice. She's so warm and welcoming and knows my order every time I go in.Thanks.\n\nFood (and none of it is greasy!):\n+ Pork chop\/cube with green sauce: INCREDIBLE. OMYGOODNESS. They're soft. They're savory. They're moist. They couldn't be better. They make me want to sing my praises from the rooftops of Phoenix.\n+ Chicken tacos: Skip them. They are kind of disappointing.\n+ Chicken tortilla soup: AMAZING. Seriously. I have yet to find one that's better. It's spicyyy and will clear your sinuses! Mmm.\n+ Refried beans: Fantastic. The best I've had, and believe me, I am well versed in Mexican food. If anyone knows beans, it's me.\n+ Chips and salsa: The chips are freshly deep fried, so they're wonderful and crunchy. The salsa is great. One is chunky and mildly hot, while the other is super smooth and super hot. Both taste amazing.\n\nAnd the best of all: their always-spotless utensils, plates, and tables make me endlessly happy. So clean :')","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Figured I'd stop in and have a quick bite and be on my way. \n\nWhen I walked in the door the first room was completely empty and there was a woman standing and staring at me. I turned to look at the sign and turned back around. She still said nothing. I asked if they were open and she said what did the sign say? I said it says open (but why the hell are you just staring at me like you are not). She finally says there is a large party coming in and to sit in the other room. I said sure. Both rooms are fairly small. The decor is pretty whack. Old office looking carpet and old booths. I'm a fan of tile in restaurants. Spilled food and drinks just don't come out of carpet and especially old office looking carpet. The tables are covered with that cheap vinyl red sticky covers that also never look or feel clean. The benches were old and had tears in them. There were 3 gentlemen in another booth and other than that the place was empty. \n\nWe were brought menus and drinks fairly quickly but no salsa. Another couple came in and sat down after us and were given chips and salsa immediately. Our waitress came back and asked if were ready to order. Still no chips and salsa. About 15 minutes into our \"quick\" lunch we were finally given a small bowl of chips and a couple of salsa. The salsa was ok. Nothing special. Same for the chips. We placed our orders and in comes out in about another 10-15 minutes. \n\nI had the El Conquistador burrito. Its a pretty large burro filled with a chile relleno, steak picado, and guac. It was ok. Really nothing good or bad. For 7.50 I expect greatness in a burrito. The wife had a bean and cheese burro w\/ enchilada sauce. They were very tight on the sauce and cheese. It was the overall theme of the place. Very tight. For extra chips and salsa it was 1.50 according to the menu. \n\nThe waitress came by another 15-20 minutes later and asked how we were. I said we were ready to go now. She didn't take our plates and she didn't bring our bill. Another 5-10 minutes goes by and I finally get up and walk to the man at the front and ask him if could pay him directly. Our waitress, who's now talking on the phone, with our dirty plates still on our tables and check no where to be found even after I asked for it, makes a statement to the man that I am ready to go. No b, I was ready to go 20 minutes ago when I told you I was done. Now I'm ready for an apron cause I've been here long enough to get paid. \n\nFrom the conversations I heard the man and woman own the place. Good for them. I wont be back and don't recommend anyone else going back. I saw a newspaper article on the wall that AZcentral or New Times recommended it as a top 10 Mexican restaurant in town. Maybe it was good before they moved to this location. Maybe they lost some key staff members. Maybe they know something I don't. I doubt it.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I thought I would be a cooler Phoenician if I could make this my new \"my place.\" \n\nPerhaps we hit on an off night (just a random Saturday), but our service was horrible. I was taking my neighbor out for dinner, and her comment was that \"we could have died back here and they wouldn't notice.\" We waited at least 5 minutes before anyone came over to give us menus or take a drink order. We alerted them that it was our first time in the establishment and asked for recommendations, which were given but wtih minimal enthusiasm. We tried giving \"the eye\" or \"the nod\" and stopped short only of getting up to refill our own drinks during the meal. \n\nOn the plus side, the food was very good and I have been craving it since my initial visit! I had a combination plate that let me taste a yummy chili relleno, taco and enchilada -- all were fantastic. My neighbor got the special (seafood enchiladas) and raved about hers as well. \n\nI will definitely visit again, but if the service isn't any better then maybe I'll turn it into my new special \"my takeout place.\"","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

They were on my radar of places to check out due to a reputation for craft beers and good food that I'd heard through a friend -- and, when they popped up as a Groupon, I jumped.  The menu and beerlist on their website really sealed the deal.\n\nI invited a couple other friends who had never been to come along, one of whom is a picky eater (and, after looking at the site, was excited), the other of whom, like me, is always looking to try new beers.\n\nSo we get to Local 4...  and it's a huge let down.\n\nThe food was mediocre to bad.  \n\nI had the bison spaghetti bolognese, which tasted as though they forgot to salt the water when cooking the noodles.  The sauce was ok, but there was precious little of it.  When I order a pasta dish at a restaurant and it's $14, I expect it to be something more than I can prep, at home, with little effort.  I wouldn't have been ashamed to serve it myself, but I certainly wouldn't have expected any particular compliments after the fact.\n\nSteak & Frites went to one friend, who's experience was similar to others here:  steak was dry, tough, bad.\n\nOther friend had the chicken cordon bleu -- she finished the chicken, which was decent (but again, nothing special), then left the potatoes and vegetables as unpalatable.  I was incredulous, so tried a few...  and she was right.\n\nBut the kicker was the beer list or, more appropriately, the lack of one.  They didn't have a single one of the craft beers we specifically came to try -- we ended up ordering some Blanche de Chambley (a personal fave, but not one I was hoping to \"try\"), then stuck with cocktails.  They didn't have MacAuslan (either apricot or stout), Black Oak, or Stonehammer (dark or light).  Are you kidding me?  You're touting your craft beers, and your selections are mostly imports, Sleemans, and a cider?  And what you do have are the most common, usual suspects: Mill St, Steamwhistle, and the like?  \n\nWe were bummed.  Add to this that the server had a rather uncaring attitude, was slow, and, when presenting the bill, just dumped it on the table.  Even forgot to factor in the Groupon, and seemed annoyed that I wanted him to adjust it.  (Now I feel like I'm ragging on the guy -- he seemed like a cool guy, just kind of out of his depth.)\n\nIn any case, I would hesitate giving a 1* rating to Local 4 if only because there's great potential there:  nice ambience, cool location, a menu that looks good on paper...  but they need to seriously re-evaluate what they're doing and their approach to food, drink, and service.\n\nJudging by recent reviews, they're certainly not watching review sites for what people are saying, and that's too bad.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

So, Yoga Oasis is great for me.  I think two other Charlotte-area studios have Bikram-inspired classes, but Yoga Oasis has the best and most true-to-form Bikram classes in our area.  If you are into Vinyasa this studio is not for you.\n\nObviously the studio is hot -- that is an integral part of the practice, so if you are going to complain about the heat you need to go to a non-hot class at another studio.  The \"fire\" and \"water\" classes are not as hot as the traditional classes, so if you are a beginner you may want to start there.  The heat is part of the challenge and can be tough even for those who have been doing Bikram for years, so give yourself some slack until you get used to it.  (Your body WILL get used to it!)\n\nThe instructors are great -- extremely friendly and willing to spend time with you to get your technique right.  A few are too chatty in class for me -- I appreciate reminders and pointers (\"chin up\", \"curl tailbone forward\", etc.) but I think some of the instructors get talking and forget how long we have been holding the postures.  I don't like moving too quickly, but I do get impatient when I know that the chattiness is going to lead to the class going over the time period.  Most of the instructors are sensitive about the length of the class but some are not -- it is not unusual to be 10-15 minutes over.  This drives me a little crazy since I am always on a tight schedule. I wouldn't say that the instructors are motivating... but they do notice when you are giving 100%.   Many of the instructors make an effort to get to know you by name and are always happy to see you.\n\nThe studio is clean.  The hot yoga room is large and mirrored with carpet.  The carpet is kind of gross but as long as you are on your mat it doesn't matter.  There is no music during class, and no talking in the yoga room.  This is different from many of the other studios around town.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and introspective.  The yogis that attend class are serious about Bikram and are generally very nice.  There is one large lady who is always naked in the shower\/changing room -- and will stand there completely naked forever and talk to whomever is in the room.  The shower\/changing room is pretty crowded so it is very awkward.  I am glad that she is comfortable with her naked body but I am not.  #gross\n\nAnyway, the yogis are generally not pretentious and not the \"Myers Park stay at home mom\" crowd that you'll find at other studios.  These are lifelong serious yogis and I love that about this place.  The students are very diverse - men, women, all ages, all races, all body types.  And, all are at different levels of their practice.  It's refreshing.\n\nAnother major plus about Yoga Oasis is the price -- $75 for 10 classes ($60 if you are a first-time student).  This is cheaper than many of the \"good karma\" deals at other studios!  It is seriously worth every penny and then some.\n\nAll in all, this is a great studio and I will keep coming back.  I am only giving 4 stars because of the limited class schedule and the frequency that the class goes over the sixty or ninety minute period.  Oh, and the carpet.  Other that those things, this place is perfect!","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The instructors were average (no personal attention or verbal tips on the poses); but very nice.  Since there is no other non-vinyasa practices here (like Bikram) that are not based around shoulder based Vinyasa flows (i.e., down-dog and handstands), I would have probably stuck with this studio but I just can NOT get away from the mildew\/fungal smell that pervades the practice space.  I REALLY tried to get past it; but it is just too distracting and disturbing - did not leave me feeling healthier.\nIf the owners or managers ever choose to replace the carpet with a more normal yoga floor I will be back.  And if anyone is aware of another instructor or studio who does a true bikram hot yoga sequence (the same 26 poses over 90 minutes) in the area please let me know!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

This deep, long stretch class was just the thing I needed. I left feeling supremely calm and my body soothed. I'm going to make weekend classes (and maybe some weekday evening ones) a habit.

I could have done it at home and probably gotten more out of it.

As far as the meditative aspects, she didn't contribute a whole lot besides \"focus on the breath\".  I'm sorry, but I like a yin yoga class with props, modifications, and readings from the Bhagavad Gita\/sutras\/poetry, exploring a theme, nice yogaisms being said, etc.  Like why even have a teacher in the room if they don't contribute anything beyond \"sit with your legs in front of you and fold over\".

If you weren't a local, you probably wouldn't know it was here.  The decor is simple but modern and the servers are all very friendly.  The main colours of the restaurant are blue and red and the lighting creates a great ambiance, with lit candles lining the rear wall.  Upstairs houses 2 of its private dining areas which accommodate groups of 20-50 guests.     There is plenty of free street parking nearby - just one of the perks of being away from restaurants in the downtown core.\n\nThe menu has a good selection of Italian dishes.  I did fell however, that the entrées list was a bit small - especially if you weren't really up for pizza or pasta.\n\nThe house wine was courtesy of House Wine Co. featuring both the Red House (a blend of Shiraz and Cabarnet) and the White House (a blend of Riesling and Pinot Grigio).  These are both wines from the Niagara region, and I highly recommend them.  The server was even kind enough to bring over the bottle so we knew what it looked like before we head to the LCBO.  Wine purists may be scoffing at me, but I like hybrids!\n\nThe starter bread basket was warm, and probably one of the better breads I've had in Toronto.  For starters, it was warm.  It got a sprinkling of salted herbs and a dousing of balsamic vinegar.  It was hard not to devour the entire thing.  The bread was perfectly crusty as if it were fresh out of the oven.\n\nWe opted to share a Spinach Salad ($10) which was tossed with a halved egg, cherry tomatoes, red onion and shaved Parmesan cheese.  I found the leaves to have been awkwardly big, and the salad itself was pretty bland.  The saving grace were the freshly toasted walnuts.\n\nFor mains I opted for the meat special, a Peppercorn Striploin served with a generous portion of sweet potato fries (which I substituted in place of regular fries).  I loved that Chef Neil Siomra placed the steak on top of the bed of fries as the jus just trickled down and gave the fries great flavour.  The steak was cooked to my requested medium-rare, but unfortunately a bit lacking in the seasoning department.  The meat itself had no real flavour and relied heavily on the peppercorn sauce to spruce it up.  The sweet potato fries were absolutely divine, not too oily, and thin-cut just the way I like them.  I'd come here just to have these again.\n\nMy dining companion opted for the pasta special which was a Snow Crab Ravioli topped with grilled shrimp. The tomato sauce was very fresh.  I would've preferred if the ravioli were cooked just a tad more.  The crab was virtually absent or drowned out by the rich cheese filling as I couldn't discern any of the lumpy meat while eating this dish.\n\nTo finish off the evening we opted to share the Raspberry & Chocolate Tartufo ($7).  While it took awhile for the actual dessert to show up, it was well worth the wait.   The thin shell had a great texture to it - it reminded me of an Italian mochi with its slightly elastic exterior that was lightly dusted with cocoa powder.  The interior filling was dense and rich, with a raspberry centre.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThe staff at Pallucci make you feel like you're in nana's house.  They're warm, and serve you with a smile.  They were always around if you needed something, and quick to remove your plates when you've finished.  I must also thank Chef Siomra for bringing us 2 separate plates of salad even though we were sharing.\n\nThe food here doesn't leave you feeling heavy, and is very fresh.  With that said, the food could benefit from a bit of flavour development.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Coffee is the lifeblood that fuels the dreams of champions.\" ― Mike Ditka, Kicking & Screaming\n\nWaltzed into Hazelrock on Opening Weekend and I think I ruined someone's video\/picture.  Oops?  I came here because my dearest friend told me to so I did!  I had snooped on their website and blog the week before so I knew I *had* to try the Ferrero cookie on top of some other goods.  Between the two of us, we had a cookie, a lemon bar that was recommended by the friendly barista with the cool hair, a macchiato, and an iced tea.  \n\nThe first sip of the espresso sent me straight onto Cloud 9.  It was rich, fragrant, and creamy.  It made Addiction stir and I was hooked by that vixen.  Girl, I will never give you up again.  The iced tea helped clean the palate as well as that super tasty and tart lemon bar.  Could this be fresh lemon juice?  If it was concentrate, it fooled me.  As for the Ferrero cookie, it was everything I imagined it would be and more.  It was crispy on the edges and soft and delicious in the middle.  Nutella and a very generous amount of hazelnuts decorated the top.  It got a tad too sweet with the ample amount of hazelnut spread but I imagine it being perfect with a foamy latte.  I wish they drew a tiny leaf in my espresso...\n\nThe coffee shop itself is very hipster industrial chic --- wood, steal, a bike, a marquee arrow, a mattress sans the cover and fluff, and glass bottles as lighting. It was very cool.  I like the concrete floors and all the reclaimed wood.  I could imagine a young Joyce sitting here with all her other art student friends, the WP Carey business majors working on their stuffy group assignments on the leather couch and arm chairs, and the regular Tempe resident grabbing a cuppa before work.  It's a large space with lots of chairs, stools, and tables for all. \n\nAnd if the drinks and pastries aren't enough to lure you in... they also sell snow.  SNOW!\n\n\"Way too much coffee.

My girlfriend and I arrived in the mid afternoon on a fairly slow day. The space was nice and open - this place would do well for those looking to study. I couldn't help but notice however the modern chicness of it all, which did come across as semi-contrived. But whatever, it still gave good energy. \n\nThe menu looked interesting and expansive. There were a few choices on there I haven't seen before, such as a coconut cold brew, or a hazelnut milk latte. After some questions about the various drinks, bean sources, etc, I opted to go for the hazelnut milk latte with white chocolate added. My girl had a Brazilian hot pour coffee coffee with hazlenut milk on the side. Tempted by the tasty looking pastries, we also decided to get a peach pie. It was a pie and coffee kind of day.\n\nWe noticed immediately that there was something off about the hazelnut milk. I was expecting something silky and slightly creamy, like good almondmilk can be. What we got tasted like wet chalk. Nasty. I had them remake my girl's coffee, and I stuck with mine. I wasn't content at all, but didn't want the hassle of them remaking two drinks. So hers came back, this time with steamed milk; but still, the coffee just wasn't good. I'm sorry - it wasn't. She and I both agreed that it tasted little better than Folger's. There was no depth, no fruit or chocolate notes, nothing. And this coming from a pour over! I can't imagine what a drip brew would taste like. \n\nMy latte, aside from the persistent chalk texture, also had no flavor. The white chocolate was non-existent. The espresso, barely distinguishable at all. It really didn't even taste like there was any in there. I've tried nearly every coffee place's latte in the Tempe and Scottsdale area, so I have a fair idea of what is good and what is not. Again, very disappointing, especially since the menu looked so promising. And the kicker to all this is the peach pie had no flavor, no life, nothing. It tasted like a frozen pie that had been defrosted and was sitting out for hours. This supposedly being a made from scratch pastry! Oh, and the barista forgot to even bring it to us, immediately after we ordered it. We had to remind her. \n\nThe people were fairly nice, and the space was inviting, which saves this place from being a one star in my book. But I know we will certainly not be back. That's a shame, because with the location, layout, and interesting drink selections, this place has potential. Right now though, it just seems all for show. A good artifice with no substance.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

I like the location, and it is a great place for studying, with lots of tables and outlets. I had been there a few times before and always had great service (one of the baristas, Emily, always gives good recommendations) but on my last visit, one of the male baristas was very rude and condescending.

Felt like I was sitting in a garage building.  The coffee and pastry bar sits in a corner far from the entrance doors.  Owners\/management: please put up better menu signs to allow first-timers and those who do not know what's available to choose, instead of feeling pressured to order something fast at the cash register- the menu was on plaques placed right in front of the register.  There were a few pastries on display, but the ones that caught my attention were on one of the guest tables.  Looked like bruschetta, but with nutella and chunky nuts.  Apparently, these were being tested for an upcoming breakfast offering.\n\nI liked the cold brew tasting-- four cold brews of your choosing, for $6.  You then get to choose a 12 oz. pour of cold brew, or opt for any pastry\/dessert from the case.  I chose Ethiopian, Apple Jack, Blackberry-Lavender, and Coconut.  Funny how the two I thought I'd enjoy the most (the last two) would be my least favorites!  I'd definitely order the Ethiopian cold brew again, and perhaps the Apple Jack with cream.  The blackberry-lavender was too tart, and I could only detect the berry, which was unfortunate, since I love lavender-scented anything: chocolates\/truffles, ice creams\/gelatos, shortbreads, soaps, and lotions, etc.  The house-made tiramisu was just OK.  Actually, I didn't eat much of it at the time, since I already had enough milk fat and sugar from the salted creme brûlée coffee here, and I ended up throwing away the leftovers at home that night, since most of the takeaway cup was filled with waxy cream filling.  The female rep here told the new guy that he must stress that everything here is made in-house, from the cold brews steeped with herbs, spices, and fruits the night before, to the hazelnut-chocolate spread and the caramel syrup and melted chocolate used in coffees.  \n\nI wished I'd gone with the huge chocolate chip cookie with the house-made hazelnut-chocolate spread, instead of the tiramisu...  I may come back for a second visit, but not before I check out all the other coffee shops I've bookmarked for years.\n\n#770","useful":39,"funny":22,"cool":36,"type":"review"}

The cupcake was heavenly, the buttercream frosting was just the right amount of vanilla, and the cupcake was moist and perfect. The winner though was the Salted Brulee Latte, oh that is a great latte, the torched of the sugar on top with the warm rich coffee below, it's a cup of heaven I tell you!\nGlad to have found a new coffee spot in my hood, I'm sure I will be back plenty of times","useful":10,"funny":6,"cool":9,"type":"review"}

The coffee there is fine, but it's always kind of a weird, tense shitshow in there. I was glad to see that the baristas in Hazelrock were not fronting the  typical coffee-chain overhyped, aggressively sunny demeanor and just spoke like real humans. Thank you.\n\nThe interior is spacious, open, and extremely clean and polished. Great care was taken to design the menu boards and they're packed with information about their proprietary beans: tasting notes, production information, growing regions (today it was Brazil, Ethiopia and Cameroon). I personally was thrilled to see this, and excited about the prospect of choosing a bean (I went with the Ethiopian).\n\nAfter ordering, I waited a few minutes and was given an iced coffee when I had wanted hot. The barista was apologetic and mentioned that she \"just assumed\" and I admitted that I didn't specify, either. However, I do think that if you don't specify, it should be hot. Isn't that the default? At any rate, I just ended up going with the iced coffee since I was in a hurry (and anyone who knows iced coffee knows that Ethiopian beans are the best for iced anyway.) No big deal. The coffee itself was great, by the way. Bright, vibrant notes, smooth and intense. Yes. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, all the high-concept, coffee-as-the-new-wine, making-the-gourmet-the-norm is essential, and there is a market for it, and it's necessary to raise the bar and lift us from the depths of the bottom of Einstein's brown-stained coffee urn, but you also have to be able to take orders, and make drinks fast and not have your baristas short circuit and blow up when someone orders \"just a decaf, please\". I think the real mark of excellence in coffee comes from a certain subtlety: exceptional coffee that doesn't need to be dressed up and called out by a long list of pseudo-Italian terms. Good coffee can be served black, as-is, and stand on its own. And no matter how you market it, if it's a good roast, people will notice.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Perfectly chocolatey, crunch and indulgent, this signature treat of Hazelrock's can easily be shared, but you probably won't want to.\n\nThe pastry case is a first come first serve situation, so once they are out of something, typically they are out of it for the day. Except for the Ferrero Rocher cookie. I've never not seen it in the case and I think its popularity demands that it's in the case at all times. I've also had the coffee cake which was an excellent, not too crumbly, not overly sweet pairing with our beverages.

I ordered a latte (they don't do flavoured lattes and it's weird that the employee didn't suggest the salted brúlée latte that several people seem to be raving about in the reviews). The latte was OK. I think if you're a coffee person you might appreciate it more. My friend got a hot chocolate with cow's milk and he thought it was watery even thou it was made with whole milk. We also tried some of the sweets: the chocolate banana tart and the ferrero rocher cookie. I don't recommend eating any of these by yourself. Make sure you share it because they are hella sweet. Not a bad thing necessarily if that's what you like. The banana chocolate tart was delicious. It has real pieces of banana in there. No laffy taffy, artificial banana flavour. I enjoyed it. The cookie is a chocolate chip cookie with nutella and hazelnuts on top. Obviously it's delicious. On my third visit, I got an iced tea. I believe it was a berry black tea. I added a couple teaspoons of sugar to it and it was good. \n\nI haven't been wowed by any drink from this place so I give them 1 star for that. \nThe two sweets that I've tried were both very good so I give them + 2 stars. That brings them to a 3 out of 5. I'm not keen to give another star for service because the employees always seem clueless about what they have. Anytime there is a girl at the register she has to ask the guy who makes the drinks what milk they have or what is in a particular drink. You should know what's in your product.

They've parked themselves in a very fortuitous location, too - smart move, guys. Why don't we get right down to business:\n\nPROS: Just about everything. Plenty of space, plenty of seating, plenty of *comfortable* seating, always bright and clean, a growing calendar of events (including, as I found out by accident the other night, magic shows!), a polite staff, a decent menu. Hazelrock quickly became an almost-daily go-to for me. I absolutely love the atmosphere. REALLY great place for hanging out, playing board games, studying - whatever. Good place for groups, good place for individuals. You really can't go wrong with this one.\n\nCONS: Only one minor con, and I blame this on my snobbiness when it comes to coffee. I've noticed a pretty conspicuous inconsistency in product quality. Not sure what to attribute this to, but the fact is, Hazelrock has a lot to compete against in this area. If they can take just that *little* bit of extra pride in how their coffee is prepared, it would up my review from four stars to five.\n\nCONCLUSION: All in all, a great addition to the budding coffee economy. Not the best coffee in the area (yet - they're still young!), but definitely one of the better locations and settings in the area. A very nice craft addition to an otherwise college area. If you haven't been, it's worth a go. You'll likely find yourself visiting often.\n\nGood job, Hazelrock! Keep up the good work.  :)","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

In fact, it is a lot more like high school than anything else. The uncool cool people prance around while spiced up oldies make communicating with anything other than hand gestures and swirling hips worthless. The black-suited security guards talking into their sleeves every few seconds also offer a real --- if not short-lived and ultimately comical --- feel that this place is actually hip. \n\nIn a word: Underwhelming.\n\nMake no mistake about it, though, Barcelona is beautifully appointed. Leather chairs and sofas make for comfy private lounges for the lucky (or wealthy) few who occupy them. The sprawling patio is an excellent place on a late summer evening in Arizona. Multiple bars make for relatively speedy service. And the overall gargantuan size of the place makes the crowd seem less, well, crowded.\n\nBut alas, this is no place for me.

A girl thinks my picture is kinda cute. I write reviews that demonstrate I passed high school English. She writes\/compliments me... I'm cocky\/funny. I offer to explore downtown with her. She turns me down. I try the next girl. Same result. But the intent is always there. After this review, I doubt I'll have to worry about succeeding with any woman who ever reads this review ever again. \n\nSo check it out. I'm a male slut. If I meet you in person and I lay my lines on you and smile in this certain way that I've discovered makes women look away and blush, you'll definitely give me your number and probably go home with me within one more encounter. That's my M.O. It works. If it ain't broke... \n\nI'm not altogether proud of the man I've become but I'm not going to stop either.

Unless me writing about it causes some cosmic\/karmic shift and I get disfigured in a car accident tomorrow and lose my mojo, I have several strong years of carousing left in me.  \n\nOk, all that said, I've been reading on Yelp about all the \"cougars\" who frequent this lovely establishment. I define a \"cougar\" not by age, but as a woman who knows what she wants (me). So my buddy, who's also a man about town and similarly successful in this field, and I decide that this is our new watering hole. We've been there twice in the last two weeks.

BBQ - If you're sitting outside on the patio, prepare to smell like BBQ chicken after you are done.  I don't know who designed this, but it was pretty poor engineering.  You don't build a BBQ in the middle of the lounge, so that your patrons get smoke in their faces.\n\n3.  Fancy Cars - Sure I love Ferrari's just as much as the next guy, but the fact that they put them in the front is sort of lame....like they're trying too hard to make themselves look uber-cool.\n\n4.  Lounge singers - they have had the same lounge singers, singing the same songs for years.  I thought that the girl was hot, but she's more of a Monet (good from afar, but all messed up when looking up close)\n\nAll in all, I give them a 3 for entertainment value (humor).  This isn't exactly the best nightclub in the world though.","useful":0,"funny":4,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The food is Ok. The Paella is huge and not bad. They try real hard to make this place the chi-chi joint for the hip resort\/snowbird crowd.

I had gotten a $20 day pass,  and had a pretty good time by the pool with my friend.    At a time, there had been some porn stars frolicking in the water, they were making hamburgers (the staff, not the porn stars),  and the place had a sort of 80's, West Hollywood-camp charm.\n\nRecently I headed to a trade show in Vegas, and for the first time my hotel room wasn't being paid for by my job, so I decided to try out the Blue Moon.\n\nPROS:  \n\nFor me, I like that it's off the strip. (Less traffic, not as many obnoxious tourists, etc.)  Also the biggest selling point for me is your proximity to your car.   (you are definitely going to want to rent a car if you stay here, in my opinion)  I absolutely hate the self parking rigamaroo  and subsequent trek through throngs of casino-goers and  miles a dreary, carpeted passageways just to get to your room that is the norm at most of the big hotels.   here you just open your car door and step inside.   it's an old TravelLodge,  so you get the idea of the setup.\n\nSince it is a gay-owned and operated business, there are a few feel-good points awarded for staying here, and supporting the community.   stuff is generally very nice and the owner is attentive, and seems to get what people want.\n\nThere is a nice breakfast spread in the morning including  2-hour coffee, which is a bonus.\n\nThere is a steam room and  kind of seedy  porn watching area,  if you're into that.\n\nCONS:   \n\nDon't go there expecting to meet a porn star.   I'm sure it happens, but this isn't the cast's quarters for Chippendale's, lol.  \n\nIf you want to have guests at the hotel, you sort of have to go  down and let them in at night.   not a big deal, and it makes sense from a security standpoint, but is not as freewheeling as some other places.\n\nIf you are used to staying at the Bellagio,  and need to park next to a Bentley  to get yourself through the day,  skip this place.   as I said, it is campy and fun,  not glamorous or chic.   but at the end of the day, ask yourself... what is Vegas really all about?","useful":8,"funny":6,"cool":4,"type":"review"}

So, we did.  Our first time.  Thankfully, we paid the Sunday night rate and we got that value.  The place as a whole is a little rough around the edges.  Other guests we talked to love the place and return.  We probably wouldn't.  It's the little things: no luggage rack for suitcase, no towel bars for bath towels (install a couple of hooks?), exposed wires on the walls (and extra bunched on the floor) for accent lighting, a foaming soap dispenser at sink and shower (really?  like a truck stop? I'm all for conserving on little bottles and soap bars - install a three-way liquid soap dispenser and that way you can also offer your guests shampoo and conditioner - which they don't now.  $16).  The back stairs that lead to the pool over look areas of junk.  Trash by the pool equipment etc.  So easy to just throw that stuff away.  It's in plain sight of guests and just adds to the attitude of general lack of care.  So, picky?  Well, maybe.  But, these very simple little things are what sets apart hotels and makes for a guest wanting to return.\n\nNow, the good stuff:  the Sunday pool party was very busy and fun.  Maybe 40 men (mostly au natural) sunning and frolicking.  Guests seemed to have a great time (bring your own cooler).  Breakfast was really excellent (a big pleasant surprise!).  Bed very comfortable and linens all nicely clean.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Free WiFi worked well in the rooms.  Large steam room was nice.  Video room was popular.  And, with the day pass system, you get to mingle with some local boys, too.\n\nSo, for the gay boys who like to roll with the boys, have a great time!  We'll pass next time.  But, then, we live in Palm Springs and get plenty of gay all the time.  For others not in that position, they'll have a different perspective.","useful":8,"funny":3,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

It is clothing optional, so if you want to lay out by the pool sans Speedo, you can. The pool area and hot tub is nice. Fun when there is a group staying there or sunday bbq pool parties. Continental breakfast is free and pretty decent.  The beds are extremely comfortable.  It's quiet.  If you want to cruise, that option is available to you. Free parking close to your room. Very happy to let me do a late check out and then hang around the pool the rest of the day until my late afternoon flight.\n\nCons:  they are 5 minutes off the strip.  Absolutely no biggy though--it's a quick car ride or cab ride to the strip.  There is nothing within walking distance for food or anything to do (sketchy industrial-ish neighborhood), but again- a quick hop to the strip.\nThe price is high relative to what you can get for a nicer strip hotel--but, if you want to stay at a clothing optional resort with other gay folks, that's what you are paying for.  The room I had wasn't fabulous---the TV was like 14\".  C'mon guys, you can get a 42\" for $250. A lot of it is in the details though--there was a light out in the bathroom.  The shower head sprayed water all over the place.  The elevator light is one exposed light.  There is \"junk\" off the pool area that you can see if you go out the end exits.  Kind of looks like the money was put in up front in the rooms and then nothing much has been updated since then.  It was a bit of a ghost town, even with Hustlaball in town (I had hoped there would be an afterparty like there was 5 years ago (which i missed!)).\n\nWould I go back?

I've also stayed here a couple of times before my last stay.  The other reviews are right on the money about the owner and the staff.  John Hessling clearly understands customer service. It is the reason why I booked a stay there a few days while the moving truck where I was relocating from was en route to Vegas.\n\nThere is also an unnecessary snarky side to the operation and seems to prevail staff-wide. Asking for extra towels or to let a guest's visitor into the property within a reasonable amount of time (was my brother-in-law, not a trick), is not an extraordinary request.  I can understand why one would feel bothered if the room was comped.  But it wasn't. I think the owner and staff have lost sight of the fact that guests are choosing to stay there rather than the Wynn (where it was cheaper for the time of my stay at Blue Moon).  When inquiring about certain clubs, I was told by the staff at the front desk they weren't allowed to promote some of them and were directed to send me to certain venues. Not illegal, nor a surprise. But pretty crappy way to deny a guest an experience.\n\nMr. Hessling also has a blog where he pens somewhat bitchy copy under the name PERSON OF INTEREST and runs a hook-up app called Bent, which, though I indulge in both, is probably hurting his attention to the details at the Blue Moon.   Sadly, it is unlikely I will come back here, nor recommend it, until it gets back into the the tip-top shape it once was--and can be again.\n\nAs for the neighborhood, this is all subjective. No one has ever been mugged, murdered, accosted (unwillingly, at least) in the area.  Hessling does put a premium on security, and for that, I have to give him credit.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Some reviews had made me wary, but the hotel and gracious staff exceeded my expectations.\n\nI was there in early March, so it wasn't \"in season\", but the pool, waterfall and jacuzzi were available.  I think the rooms are terrific, mine had a huge flatscreen, separate sound system, couches, chairs and a bathroom that was brightly lit (hard to find in any hotel).  I had a fridge and bar sink in the main living area, a huge walk in closet and windows that actually opened.\n\nYou do need to depend on cabs or a car, but there is free parking, steps from the entrance, not like the half mile long jaunts from the parking lots of the large strip hotels.  While the area is mostly industrial, there are several other properties within half a block.  I never felt unsafe.\n\nJohn, one of the owners, was on the property almost every day and couldn't have been nicer.  \n\nIf you're looking for cruising, you'll find it.  If you're not, you'll have a pleasant stay in a unique property with a friendly stay who will go out of their way for you.  At the time I traveled, my room was half the price of most of the mid-range strip hotels, so the affordability was a huge plus.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The waitress didn't know the menu AT ALL, and was not so attentive.\n\nNot the best prices, either.  $4 for veggie pakora appetizers, $10.50 for my channa masala and $11 for his chicken tikka masala, $3.50 for naan to share.\n\nThe food was pretty awesome.  The pakoras were delicious, and there was a big plate of them.  The chutneys were really good as well.  The entrees were spicy, but not overwhelming.  Very tasty!!  The rice was perfectly cooked, which makes such a big difference.  The garlic naan was definitely the stand-out dish.  Buttery and very garlicky and had a great texture to it.

They change their items on the buffet each time, they told me.  \n\nMy kids like the Tandoori chicken. They have melons\/fruits for dessert, too, so the kids like that, as well. And the naan--well, the naan--what can you say about naan? mmmmmm. Naan is a type of Indian bread, in case you've not had it. and it's fantastic here. Waaay too much carbs when you eat here!!  \n\nI asked about the samosas--I have never been able to find small samosas since living in the middle east where they had Indians and Pakistanis on the streets with carts selling samosas (the small ones). I finally asked, and the guy told me they are a specialty item and hard to get. The big ones are easy to get. I don't care for the big ones.\n\nThe downfall to this place--the service isn't the best here. If you order water, they don't keep your glass full, and sometimes it tastes bad and you have to ask for a fresh glass of water. AND, they never know how much the kids are supposed to cost for the buffet. There's no sign for prices,and when you ask, you get a different answer each time!  A few times they didn't charge us for the 1-yr olds' buffet, and the last time we went, we were charged for both kids. I said, I thought he was free (indicating my 1yr old) and the kid serving us got the manager, who was an American female (no Indians to be found manning the floor) and she said there was a charge for each person's meal.

Spicy, smoky and just delish, had a potato dish too, think its called aloo methi?

Both the butter chicken and chili chicken are white meat and so very delish, also had some of the vegetable biryani and nana bread too.  Meal and Date were perfect!

I can appreciate the aesthetic value of it, just as I can appreciate the attempt to make a walkable neighborhood. Unfortunately, only this synecdoche of Tempe is walkable: the majority of visitors have to drive to get here (not good for a bar-hopping\/drinking-and-driving destination) and the lack of amenities would still make it difficult to live and work here without a car, unless they shop for groceries at the corner CVS.

In the old days, Mill was more of a bohemian paradise, with hippie street performers, people walking in the street and a cookie shop that opened it's doors and wafted the smell of cookies through the air.\n\nToday, the Mill Avenue District (Isn't \"District\" a bit lofty of a word to describe a two mile strip on one street?) has been more commercialized.  Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing - look at 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica, that's commercial and fun.  But Mill is home to several bars, 3 clothing stores and a mixture of expensive and inexpensive restaurants.  If they had truly thought out their expansion, they would have branched out a while ago and made an \"arts district\" a \"shopping district\" etc.  As it its now, they have no idea what it's supposed to be, but they slapped the \"Mill Avenue District\" name on it to give people the feeling they're living in a real city.\n\nMill's real problem now is that the buildings are too expensive for anyone not representing a giant company to afford.  Even if they somehow afford one, the rent and the lack of people buying things usually drives them in the ground (Swell Clothing RIP).\n\nHowever, Mill is not without it's merits.  If you ARE looking for a place to get drunk, it's very convenient, especially for ASU students.  Slices is a great no nonsense pizza by the slice joint.  Occasionally, there are events like the Arts Festival, which end up being fun.\n\nOverall, Mill is better than nothing, but it's got a long way to go.","useful":7,"funny":6,"cool":5,"type":"review"}

It's been a while, I thought, and many of the corporate chains that ruined the street are fleeing as fast as their trucks can carry them off. It's worth a shot. \n\nI attempted to park in front of the now-vacant Z-Gallerie, only to find that meters had been installed. Of course, nobody carries change nowadays, so I followed the blue sign that read \"Public Parking\" and wound up in the virtually empty parking garage. I spent less than an hour on the street, and when I was leaving the business I'd come to visit, I asked about having my parking pass validated. \"We don't do that any more,\" I was told. \"They took our equipment. Anyway, the first hour's free.\" Back at the parking garage, I was surprised when the attendant in the booth, without a word of greeting, said flatly, \"Two dollar.\" \"Two dollars?\" I asked him, explaining that the first hour was free, at least according to a business owner on the street. \"Two dollar,\" he said again. I had no cash, and told him so. \"Two dollar. Two dollar,\" said the parrot in his little cage. I asked him where I could get cash on the street and he said, exasperated, \"Is two dollar!\"\n\nI backed up (unsurprisingly there was nobody behind me), parked, and, already running late for an appointment, walked to the kiosk at Bank of America, was asked for spare change by a kid lounging on the sidewalk, crossed the street, re-entered the parking garage, drove up to the booth, and again presented my parking pass to the attendant, who now said, without irony, \"Three dollar.\" Evidently it cost another dollar to walk across the street to pay the already extortionate sum of two dollars. Wordlessly I handed him a twenty and, ignoring the faint smile on his lips, left Mill Avenue, this time for good. \n\nThe last time I visited Mill (more than a year ago), I received a $40 parking ticket after having lingered too long in Borders -- another business that I see has pulled up stakes and fled for a more profitable street. At the time, though, Mill Avenue was bustling. People wanted to be there. Yesterday the street was virtually abandoned, the storefronts mostly empty, the few people I encountered seemingly killing time between classes at ASU. In short, it was devoid of life. And for this they charge to park? For this they make things as difficult as possible, both for visitors and for the businesses nobody wants to visit anymore? And why would they, when they can visit the same chain stores selling the same items in any mall in America? But as usual, it's the independent businesses who suffer -- the ones who were forced out during the first wave of Mill Avenue's corporate takeover, and the ones there now, who are fighting for their lives.\n\nWhat they've done to this once-charming street is a travesty.","useful":4,"funny":3,"cool":3,"type":"review"}

At the north end of the party was a stage that generally included a well known music performance. \n\nNow that Tempe has taken over, the only significant difference between NYE and any other night on Mill is the crowded sidewalks. Now, while I have a hard time faulting a non-profit for backing away from a losing venture, in the case of the Fiesta Bowl, an organization that has proven to be a private circle jerk for Arizona's most-connected individuals, where their organization benefits heavily from public support well beyond their NP status, they seem to only find losing ventures as those which do not provide the most value to the Fiesta Bowl members personally.

Even their receipts have Chinese printings. That should raise some flags in your mind about how authentic this place is. But being the only choice for Thai food in the area, you don't really have a choice. After my first visit, I don't think this place is all bad. Some dishes were a hit and some were a miss.\n\nWe ordered a Thai combo for 4 for take out. They said the food will be ready in 10 minutes and they weren't kidding. I arrived about 10 minutes after I placed the call and the food was ready and packaged and sitting on the counter. We took the food home to eat and it pretty much confirmed my suspicions on authenticity. I'll comment on each item.\n\nRed Curry: Best dish of the night and tastes authentic. The dish is loaded with flavor and chicken pieces.\n\nPhad thai chicken: I've had phad thai at many places and there seems to be a wide range of difference. PP's phad thai feels like Chinese stir-fry to me. It seems to be missing some key Thai ingredients. Too light on the fish sauce, not enough eggs, and I think they used onions instead of shallots. \n\nBasil Beef: I don't feel the basil. It kind of tastes like regular Chinese stir-fry beef with veggies with an added spiciness. Compared with the red curry, the there's a lot less meat in this dish. Not bad, but doesn't feel Thai enough.\n\nTamarind Shrimp: I never want to eat this dish again. This is not tamarind. This tastes like Chinese sweet and sour sauce, and not a very well made one.\n\nTheir prices aren't cheap, but not outrageously expensive either. The portion size is generous. I would come again, but I'm definitely going to stick with the curries. I suspect this place uses powders for some dishes. I don't see how they could have prepped my meal so quickly otherwise. I'm most disappointed by the Phad Thai and the Tamarind shrimp. But I wouldn't mind ordering a curry again.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Die guten Bewertungen im Internet, welche das Restaurant als bestes in Sindelfingen darstellen, sind teilweise Gefälligkeitsbewertungen, wie sich schon am Schreibstil leicht feststellen läßt. Zudem sind 25 Bewertungen von Personen, welche nur eine einzige Bewertung veröffentlich haben.\nDoch der Reihe nach:\n1. Besuch- Weihnachtsfeier unserer Firma- (ca. 25 Personen). Personal und Küche total überfordert. Getränke liefern funktionierte sehr schleppend und bis das letzte Essen kam, waren über 3 Stunden vergangen. Während sich ein Teil der Kollegen unten auf der Kegelbahn vergnügte, saßen andere da und warteten und warteten und warteten. Dabei war angekündigt, daß wir nach dem Essen gemeinsam die Kegelbahn nutzen wollen.\n2.Besuch- abends mit 3 Personen- Gaststätte relativ leer, dadurch Bedienung in akzeptabler Zeit, allerdings das Essen nicht übermäßig üppig. Da ich meine Frau und einen Bekannten eingeladen hatte, empfahl ich eben noch einen Nachtisch zu nehmen. Jetzt zeigte sich etwas, was in anderen Bewertungen im Internet schon sehr häufig beschrieben wurde, die familiäre Atmosphäre des Restaurants. Der Kellner setzte sich zu bekannten Gästen an den Tisch. Der Rest des Lokals wurde ab dem Zeitpunkt ignoriert, was sowohl Speisen, als auch Getränke betraf. Nach einer halben Stunde wurde es selbst dem Koch zuviel und er kam in die Gaststube, um den Kellner darauf hinzuweisen, daß seit 30 Minuten unser Tiramisu auf die Abholung wartet.\n3.Besuch -2 Paare- Im Sommer mal wieder ein Besuch. Restaurant relativ gut gefüllt und wir saßen auf der Terasse. Das man beim Bringen der Karte gleich die Getränkebestellung aufnehmen kann, war dem Kellner unbekannt, daher auch diesmal wieder lange Wartezeiten auf Essen und Getränke. Das Essen war nicht schlecht, aber so wenig, daß nicht einmal die beiden Frauem satt wurden. Unser Bekannter meinte dann auch zu seiner Angetrauten:\"Eigentlich hätte ich gern mal bei Dir gekostet, aber als ich die paar Stücken auf Deinem Teller gesehen habe, habe ich mich das nicht mehr getraut.\". Diesmal haben wir es dem Kellner auch mitgeteilt, daß niemand satt ist. Er empfahl uns noch Bruschetta oder Pizzataschen zu nehmen, was wir auch taten (natürlich auf Rechnung). Die anschließenden Ramazotti nach dem Essen waren natürlich brühwarm und der Getränkenachschub wie immer schleppend. Wir waren allerdings gut gelaunt und wollten uns dies auch nicht verderben lassen, so nutzen wir die Zeit um mal mit zu stoppen, wie lange die anderen Gäste so auf ihr Essen warten. Bei 2 jungen Burschen neben uns waren es anderthalb Stunden. Ein weiteres Paar fiel leider aus der Wertung, sie hatten zwar die Speisekarte erhalten, entschlossen sich aber nach ewiger Wartezeit auf die Bedienung zu gehen, daher mußten wir sie leider disqualifizieren. Irgendwann haben wir übrigens angefangen, unsere 8 leeren Gläser von Hefeweizen, Wein und Ramazotti am Tischrand in einer Reihe aufzustellen. Der Kellner verstand diesen \"dezenten\" Hinweis nicht. Das beim Kassieren das Weizenbier teurer war als ausgepreist, passte ins Bild.\n4. Besuch-4 Kumpels- Ich wollte mit 3 Freunden und dem Zug in den Schwarzwald, also entschieden wir uns vor den 4 Stunden Zugfahrt noch eine Pizza zu essen. Es war Freitagmittag und die Gaststätte mittelprächtig gefüllt. Nachdem die Bedienung wieder auf sich warten lies, ging ein Freund zur Theke, um nachzufragen, ob wir in einer Stunde und 15 Minuten 4 Pizza haben könnten. Dies war laut Kellner nicht möglich. PS. Im Eiscafe Firenze am \"Berliner Platz\", wo wir anschließend hingingen, war dies trotz mittlerweile kürzerer Zeit kein Problem. Fazit: Obwohl es nur 100 Meter zu fuß sind, nie wieder \"La romantica\"!!!!\"","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Wir haben dieses Lokal aufgrund von Bewertungen ausgesucht. Wir waren das erste und das letzte Mal dort. Siehe unten!\nBedienung\nWir hatten telefonisch einen Tisch für 2 bestellt. Vom Kellner wurden wir an einen Tisch platziert, der direkt neben dem Besteckschrank war. Aus diesem wurde während unseres Aufenthaltes permanent Besteck auf Teller geknallt und in gebückter Haltung an unserem Tisch vorbeigeschlichen.\nDer Tisch wurde nicht vom Bestellkellner abgeräumt, sondern wortlos von einem Mann in Straßenkleidung, also mit Trenchcoat.\nDas Essen\nZur Vorspeise hatten wir Carpaccio bestellt. Auf unsere Frage, ob dies mit Rucola sei, wurde selbstverständlich geantwortet. Auf meine Bitte, den Rucola wegzulassen, da ich diesen nicht mag, wurde mir geantwortet, das geht nicht,  dann machen wir es eben mit Eisbergsalat. Auf die Bitte meines Mannes, das ganze ohne Salat zu servieren ist der Kellner wortlos davongegangen. Bekommen haben wir dann ein Carpaccio, das über und über  mit rohen Champigons belegt war. Als unsere Vorspeisenteller abgeräumt wurden, wurden wir gefragt, wie es war. Meine Antwort, daß zu viele Champignons drauf waren, wurde mit einem Lächeln und Gemurmel quittiert. Ich hatte den Eindruck, daß ich nicht verstanden wurde.\nZur Hauptspeise hatte mein Mann Ravioli mit Kalbfleischfüllung mit frischen Karotten und Erbsen auf Tomatensosse. Das ganze kam sehr angetrocknet, die Karotten waren von der Form her Dose oder Glas.\nIch hatte Tagliatelle mit grünem Spargel auf einer leichten Gamba-Sahne-Sauce. Die Nudeln waren einwandfrei bissfest, die leichte Sahne-Sauce entpuppte sich als stopfende und viel zu schwere Sahne-Sauce.\nDas Ambiente\nTische waren eingedeckt, Sie wurden von einer jungen Dame mit weißen Stoffhandschuhen eingedeckt; für mich in diesem Lokal völlig fehl am Platze.\nSauberkeit\nIm großen und ganzen sauber, Toiletten wurden nicht benutzt.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Der Wein war überraschend frisch und nicht ölig also nicht zu schwer. Auch hier ein Volltreffer !\nEs gibt auch eine eigene Pastaherstellung wo man zuschauen und natürlich bestellen kann.\nDas Ambiente\nInnen, einfach aber gemütlich.

Wie schon gesagt gab es als Hauptgericht ein Nudelgericht (frische Nudeln aus der hauseigenen Nudelproduktion) mit frischen Steinpilzen. Für mich gab es eine Dorade, es war außen kross gebraten und innen zart saftig, als Beilage gab es Bratkartoffeln in Weißweinsauce. Der Wein hat fantastisch zum Essen gepaßt, so konnten wir zur 2.

Ich nahm per eMail Kontakt mit dem Restaurant auf und bekam direkt Antwort vom Besitzer der gleichzeitig auch der Chefkoch ist. Mit ein paar kurzen Mails zwischen uns, klärten wir in etwa die Speisenfolge für unser Menü und letztlich versprach uns der Chef er würde uns mit einem köstlichen Fünf-Gänge-Menü überraschen. Auf diesen Deal liess ich mich ein und das war definitiv kein Fehler sondern eine gute und richtige Entscheidung.\nAls wir an dem Abend im Restaurant ankamen, wartete auf uns bereits ein liebevoll mit Rosenblättern, einem Rosenstrauß und einem silbernen Kandelaber mit aprikotfarbenen Kerzen dekorierter, edel mit Stofftischdecke und Stoffservietten eingedeckter Tisch.\nDer äußerst freundliche Kellner begrüßte uns und führte uns zu unsere mTisch. Unaufgefordert brachte er uns dann sogleich je ien Glas Prosecco als Aperitiv und zum Anstossen auf den Abend. In diesem Moment erschien auch der Chef selbst. Er kam aus der Küche, begrüßte uns ebenfalls sehr freudnlich und erläuterte uns mit welchen Genüssen er uns nun zu verwöhnen gedachte.\nDie Speisenfolge die er für uns ausgesucht hatte war folgende:\n1. Lachstranchen auf Weißbrot mit gedünsteten Gemüsestreifen 2. Vitello Tonnato mit selbstgebackenem Pizzaofenbrot3. Teigtaschen gefüllt mit Ricotta-Scampi-Lachs-Farce auf karamellisiertem Spinatbett4. Gegrillter Wolfsbarsch an würziger Orangensauce mit Pizzaofenbrot5. Panna Cotta auf Kramellspiegel\nDazu empfahl er uns als Getränk einen Weisswein, den wir allerdings nach kurzer Diskussion (da wir lieber Rotwein trinken) in einen 2003er Vino Nobile di Montepulciano umwandelten.\nDie Speisen die gereicht wurden, waren alle von erlesener Qualität und Frische. Jeder Gang - das war deutlich erkennbar - war vom Chef mit Kreativität und Hingabe zubereitet worden.\nDie Speisen waren auf Geschirr unterschiedlicher Form, sehr dekorativ und liebevoll angerichtet und waren köstlich im Geschmack. Die Mengen waren eher zu großzügig denn zu knapp bemessen und wir konnten meist die jeweilige Menge nicht vollständig verzehren.\nDas äußerst aufmerksame und dennoch sich dezent im Hintergrund  haltende Servicepersonal, sorgte dafür dass immer die Gläser mit Wein (der natürlich dekantiert worden war und in einem Dekanter gereicht wurde) und auch Wasser gefüllt waren, sowie wurde stets dezent nachgefragt, ob die Speisen und auch alles andere zu unserer Zufriednheit sei und ob ggf. etwas zusätzliches - wie z.B. ein Espresso zwischendurch - gereicht werden dürfe.\nDie absolute Krönung dieses ohnehin genial positiven gastronomischen Erlebnisses kam am Schluss, nach dem köstlichen Dessert, als der Chef aus der Küche sich - nach vorherigem Fragen selbstverständlich - mit zu uns an den Tisch sass, uns noch einen hervorragenden Grappa als Digestive und auf Kosten des Hauses anbot.\nVorher hatte er allerdings noch gefragt, ob er ein Foto von uns an diesem besondern Abend machen und uns noch ein Geschenk zum mitnehmen anbieten dürfe.\nKurz, das Foto diente dazu von ihm auf ein T-Shirt gedruckt zu werden, das er uns als Abschiedsgeschenk überreichte und dabei sehr ehrlcih sich dafür bedankte, dass wir seine Gäste waren und ihn und seine Speisen und sein Team gelobt haben.\nDer absolute Knaller kam nun aber ganz zum Schluss, als ich eher im Spass erwähnte, dass ich aufgrund des doch mehr als erwarteten Genusses von Prosecco, Wein und Grappa nun wohl doch ein Taxi rufen müsse und meinen Wagen dann eben am nächsten Morgen irgendwie abholen müsse. Da bot sich der Chef spontan an, natürlich nur wenn es uns recht wäre, uns mit unserem eigenen Wagen nach Hause zu fahren und sein Chefkellner mit seinem Wagen hinterher, so daß er wieder zurück kommen würde.\nWir haben das tatsächlich so gemacht und ich kann nur sagen, die Jungs und Mädels im La Romantica sowie das was sie bieten ist allererste Klasse und man wird so etwas und vor allem so eine Einstellung so leicht nirgendwo sonst finden!\nEines ist sicher, wann immer wir künftig in der Nähe sein werden, werden wir sicher dort wieder einkehren und ich bin fast sicher, vermutlich wie alte Freunde begrüßt und verwöhnt werden!\nFazit: Nicht nur empfehelnswert sondern ein absolutes Muss für jeden Gourmet und Freund italienischer Gastfreundlichkeit!\nÜbrigens, es soll nicht unerwähnt bleiben, dass der zu entrichtende Preis für diesen genialen Abend inkl. allen Getränken usw. mit rund 100€ auch wohl als mehr als preiswert zu bewerten ist.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Fries that came with children's menu mac 'n cheese were overdone, too brown & crunchy. Mac 'n cheese was too hot for the baby to eat at first, but he wolfed it down eventually. My scrambled eggs were overdone and lukewarm. This place does not know how to do scrambled eggs. Waitress asked if I wanted my bacon crispy and I said yes - it came out almost burnt and cold. The toast was so smeared with butter substitute that it was soggy and cold by the time I got to it. Husband's order was wrong - eggs over easy turned into scrambled eggs, and his eggs were overdone too. He enjoyed his sausage and pancakes though, and I thoroughly enjoyed my hashbrowns. They were delicious. Granddaughter liked her kids' menu French toast and ate most of it. My coffee was good, but I had to bring my own flavored creamer - all they have is plain cream and sugar.\n\nOur waitress asked when we first were seated if we'd been there before, and we said yes. She breezed by 15 minutes later and asked the same question again. We said yes again. She seemed very rushed, distracted, and not terribly friendly. The place was busy, so maybe she was overworked, but we ended up feeling rushed too. \n\nOur waitress brought two loyalty cards with our bill, both with one stamp on them - she didn't ask if we already had a loyalty  card. Did she miss the part where we said yes, we'd been there before? When I presented my loyalty card to her and asked her to put the two new stamps on my card, she said (with attitude), \"We don't combine cards!\" I had to explain that she didn't even ask if I had one, and that I simply wanted her to stamp my card instead of giving us two new ones. She gave me one stamp on top of a spot that was already stamped, and when I pointed it out, she just gave me a new card with one additional stamp. We never did get that second extra stamp, but by that time, we were done with her. We left a minimal tip.\n\nToday's experience is pretty typical in terms of food quality. We go only if we have coupons. Unless I have a really great deal, like a Groupon or a two-for-one, I'll never visit 5 and Diner again. It simply doesn't impress me with its service or its food.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It's what I would expect for a Five and Diner, which is why I give it four-star rating over all. What can I say?  I'm very picky about my food and my staff and my atmosphere. \n\nThe fries are great when you order them extra-crispy (which is how I always order my fries if I happen to get them).

Normal question when ordering breakfast right? Well, when the bill came, little did we know that the pancake sandwich didn't actually come with bacon and the server put a dollar charge on the tab for adding bacon. When I confronted her about the dollar charge she said \"the pancake sandwich doesn't come with bacon, that's extra\". Well, we weren't informed that answering a question as to preference would result in an extra charge. We weren't informed that she was in fact adding things to our tab to inflate the price without telling us. I put up enough of a fuss that she removed the charge, and  I could tell that she knew she had added the charge in a duplicitous manner and she was just hoping we wouldn't catch on. The food was decent, but I have a big problem with dishonest servers and that's what knocks this place down from being a decent breakfast joint to just another bump on the road of mediocre cuisine.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Some of them actually recognize us by face which is nice. \n\nThe restaurant itself is really nice, some of the seats are a bit beat up but otherwise it's always really clean and they have mini juke boxes at each table and you get 2 songs for a quarter so bring your change! Unless you hate 50s music that is. It's also all 50 decor inside so if you're looking for a nostalgic place, this is the place to go.\n\nAs for the shakes, everyone is right in saying they are awesome and they're HUGE. I can almost never finish them. \n\nOver all, I'd highly suggest this place and also you can ask for the discount cards so if you get 7 meals, you get 1 free. It's not very pricey either which is a plus.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Here's a useful bit of information for my fellow Chicagoans: 5 & Diner serves Vienna pure beef hot dogs. My personal lunch favorite, my main reason for giving them five stars, is their veggie burger, which I order with green chile, no cheese, and a side of french fries. Be sure to ask for the Cholula hot sauce. This is a great casual dining spot with a classic diner motif and golden oldies playing regularly to accompany your meal.

It's set that way so you can have the opportunity to taste other things on the menu without getting full.\n\nStepping inside, the atmosphere was dark and intimate, a good place to take out a date to talk and drink wine together. The LCD tv at the center of the bar kind of ruins that mood a bit though. Monday night football was on and no one was really paying attention to it because everyone was involved in their own intimate private conversation and having one tv in this type of setup just doesn't blend in well.\n\nDespite having only one server that night, she was very attentive to everyone inside. I'll give the service a good review. I ordered the mixto ceviche (shrimp, scallop and calimari). The tortilla came separate with it which were served in potato chips size pieces.  Taste was ok but thats because I prefer my ceviche with a heavy lime taste.  I also ordered the fish taco which came in 3 small pieces.  I tasted my friends tuna ceviche too which I recommend to anyone that comes here. It was the best dish we had on our table.\n\nSo if you're ever around town square at night and on a movie date, stop by this place after.

Additionally, throw in the mojitos and tapas and we have the perfect summer spot. \nHowever, there are a couple things they need to work on.  The servers were amazing. The bartenders were a little slow and unresponsive but seeing the work it takes to make a mojito, I understand. \n\nWhat was strange was the managers that stood around and did nothing. No hi, no bye, nothing, just stood there taking up space. At first, I figured that maybe they were customers but later found out they were managers who just got in the way of the servers and the customers. It'd be better if they would of had personalities. Hopefully, that'll change as business increases.\n\nThe sangria was amazing ... and I don't even like sweet drinks. But the food was very subpar. It's nothing special and was very mediocre compared to a place like Firefly. As a matter of fact we ordered about ten different items on the menu and maybe the only thing that stood out was the mushroom ceviche and the dates with bacon (even though Firefly's is better but how do you mess up something with bacon wrapped around it anyway). Everything else was ... eh and will not have me running back there to eat. With places that have waaaaayyyy better food within walking distance (Johhny McGuire's, Yardhouse, Bar Louie, and even Cadillac Ranch) I'd rather eat somewhere else and afterwards go grab a couple drinks at night here.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Tapas is small plates of each. Needless to say, when I got back to NY, I looked up a ceviche place within 24 hours.\n\nIf you are going once I'd recommend trying the ceviche, piggy back dates in goat cheese mouse, shrimp in chicharran sauce, short ribs and save room for homemade churros or that chocolate kiss with sea salt and chipotle sauce (?!?!?) \n\n- Hamachi ceviche - for those rookies like me....this is like sashimi\/fish \"cooked\" in citrus by the acid. I've never had pickled hot peppers but its like sweet hot tangy awesomeness. (is it obvious I'm not a professional reviewer?) \n\nShrimp in chicharran sauce - crispy shrimp (they use 3 flours) with a little bit of pop. \n\nShort ribs -- one large short rib in guava glaze. Its probably the best bbq sauce with rich, slightly tangy, but smooth flavor. The meat was fall off the bone tender. \n\nPiggy back dates -- a must have. dates wrapped in bacon with an almond inside for some pop and then in a bed of white mousse. Come on!  I could eat these on the coach all day.  Best dish. A must have. \n\n- Mojitos - I have to admit I didn't have but was with 10 people and the mixed drinks and variations on the mojito shocked people. \"Not as sweet\" as most. \n\nLastly, service was perfect as you'd expect the timing for each dish to be difficult. \n\nI want to sit outside next time but it was packed so that wasn't possible but they seem to have the best view in town square. \n\nGun to my head I'd say I didn't like the chicken skewers but it turned out they were missing the rum glaze so that was the reason. \n\nI think what I loved most was just the variations on every dish. Yes they have corn dogs but they have chorizo. Yes the have mac and cheese but its has habanero in it. Piggy back dates with almonds and white mousse? Can you picture what that taste like? There's something for everyone here. Ceviche, mac and cheese, shrimp, pickled jalapenos, bread pudding. Not joking this place reminded me of dishes at Nobu and as I said to a friend, \"I'm not just saying this, but this might be the best meal I ever had\" I felt like I was trying to find something I didn't find mindblowing to seem credible when I told friends about it.

I know everyone on Yelp is obsessed with Firefly, but I can now confidently say I much prefer Cana! Before I get onto the main review, a few reasons why this place kicks Firefly's butt:\n\n*Well crafted, DELICIOUS drinks. I know we all love those sugary mojitos at Firefly, but the flavorings are all just powders and artificial. The fruit mojitos here are muddled with real fresh fruit - they used a half pint of blueberries on one freaking mojito that I watched them make! I much prefer real fruit to powdered mixes, but to each his own.\n\n*Service is exponentially better. The bartenders will actually take the time to get to know you and make sure you love your drink. My mojito gets thrown at me with no hello at FireFly\n\n*Atmosphere. I love the sexy lounge\/patio they have going! Happy hour is till 7, instead of ending at 6 PM like it does on FF on Paradise. \n\n--------------------------\n\nI've said it once and I'll say it again - the drinks are awesome and they are why I come here. The mojitos are muddled with fresh fruit, and they have some awesome martinis. I do have to give the edge to Firefly on the sangria, however. They only have one kind at Cana and it's just oK.\n\nWe've tried half the menu and love nearly everything we've tried. I think the low point is sadly  the ceviche. We tried their best selling yellowtail ceviche and while it was fresh, I don't like their funky new style. If I want ceviche I want small pieces of fish, not 4 huge ugly slabs. It was sloppy and uninspired imo.\n\nOn the flip side, we really loved the beef empanadas. They aren't traditional, but wow the puff pastry dough is good. The mac and cheese is great as are the sliders. The flat breads and shrimp are both great and hearty portions to boot. I think our favorite was the short rib. A pretty damn big slab for $12 and covered in the most delicious sauce. \n\nIf you're a Firefly regular - give it a try. It's more sophisticated and the drinks are way better! You might just like it .","useful":5,"funny":2,"cool":4,"type":"review"}

We sat out on the patio to enjoy the nice night and because they only allowed happy hour specials at the bar\/patio.  However, we would rather sit out there because it was just too dark in the dining area.\n\nThese are the tapas we ordered:\n-Mac and cheese with the habenero:  We all liked this very much that we  doubled the initial quantity.  The habenero gave this tapa a lil kick and was a wonderful compliment.\n\n-Beef empanadas-this was everyone's favorite.  Was light and fluffy with ground beef and other spices in the middle...yum\n\n-Chicken empanada-not as good as the beef empanadas, but is aight.\n\n-Spicy tuna ceviche-one of us doesn't eat sushi\/sashimi, but she thought this was delicious.  I honestly thought it was a bit too fishy while everyone else liked it.\n\n-Hamachi tiradito-the citrus brought out the flavor of this fish.  Was light and refreshing.  Was one of everyone's favorite.\n\n-Cuban Sliders-ham on top of pork, was kinda boring to me.  I like cuban sandwiches when there is a dipping sauce.  This one doesn't come with a dipping sauce.\n\n-Crispy Shrimp-one said that this reminds her of honey walnut shrimp, I didn't care too much for it.  The shrimps were tiny.\n\n-Beef taco-Better than the fish, not as good as the chicken taco.  The portion seem to be tiny for the amount of pickled cabbage given.\n\n-Chicken taco-Taste the best out of the three kinds of taco.  The pickled purple cabbage and a slice of jalapeno tasted very good with this chicken taco.\n\n-Fish taco-least favorite...the fish was BORING.  Didn't taste like much.\n\n-Churros-Everyone loved this desert.  It was so soft and fluffy, with a nice vanilla sauce (I think) drizzled on top of it.  Not a typical churro that one would get at El Pollo Loco, which I like too btw.\n\nSopapillas-Eh.  Whatevers.  A rectangular baked dough on a dish of honey and powdered sugar.  \n\nSugarcane sangria-This was GOOD.  Even for non-drinkers as myself.  Was very fruity with fruit pulp.  \n\nBlackberry mojito-Was on the tart side.  No one liked this pitcher very much...\n\nSo, happy hour is definitely the time to go to try out many different tapas and drink the sugarcane sangria.

Most dishes hover right above $10, and the portions certainly do not match what you're paying for.  Last night was my third visit here, and each time I've been sure to stop by during happy hour.  Happy hour is from 5pm-7pm daily and gets you the following items at discount price (discount prices are listed below, and are approx. ~50% off full price, plus or minus $1):\n\nBeef Empanadas, $6.00 - It's alright.  Ground beef with some veggies inside pastry bread.  I'll eat it but it's not my first choice.  Comes with two empanadas, each cut in half.\nMac & Cheese, $4.00 - This is some tasty mac & cheese, using white cheese, cheddar cheese and some habanero.  The kick from the habanero makes this something that I would order every visit.  Portion is good for two, maybe three less-hungry people.\nCuban Sliders, $6.00 - These are delicious little burgers!  Made with ground pork, with a little ham thrown on top just because.  They've been juicy and full of flavor every time I've ordered these (which happens to be every time I've been here).  Order comes with three sliders, which are small to begin with.  Not worth full price.\nCrispy Shrimp, $6.00 - Yes, it is pieces of shrimp.  Yes, it was probably crunchy at some time with some sort of breading.  But no, it is not crispy when it arrives.  Last night was the first time I ordered it, and the sauce it comes with (panko?) made the shrimp soggy.  It had a citrus flavor and wasn't bad, but I can't see myself ordering it again.  Portion was decent enough for two to share.\nChicken Skewers, $? - The fifth and final food item on the happy hour menu.  The menu is small to begin with, and only five items are offered with happy hour pricing!  I *think* I had this during a previous visit but I'm not sure.  I didn't order it last night.\nSangria, $5.00 - I think there were a couple varieties offered during happy hour, each being $5.00.  It's not my favorite drink so I didn't order.\n\nDuring my visits it seems that on average people are paying roughly $15-$20 per person depending on who gets drinks.  When I go to Firefly with a group it's usually about $20 per person and the food is tastier, with more generous portions.  Cana's food is good from what I've tasted so far, but the prices are scaring me off from trying the other items, no matter how good they look.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

My only complaint is that the place has been pretty dead every time I've been there... sure I don't like super crowded places, but I would literally be the only one talking in this place at times when the other 5 groups of people that were there would collectively have a lull in their conversations.  I don't know if people just haven't heard of this place or what.  The mojitos will keep me coming back, and hopefully a following will build for this place so it's a little more lively in the future.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

So, when I saw this place in Town Square I had to check it out.\n\nFirst of all, there are 2 entries for Caña on yelp. Both refer to the same place but one has the address wrong. The correct address is 6599 Las Vegas Blvd. I'm posting my review under both.\n\nNow for the review... Caña is located in the spot vacated by Louis's Fish Camp and they did a great job of remodeling the space. Louis's had a small bar and the entry way was a little odd -- kinda felt like you were walking in through the back door to get into the restaurant because of the small door, walking by the bathrooms and getting a glimpse of the \"behind the bar\" area before getting to the dining area. With Caña, the doorway is larger and more inviting and the bar is pushed back, adjoining the patio areas. The interior of the place is much darker and intimate as well. The bathrooms are in the same location but are not as pronounced.\n\nAs for the food... ehh... it was ok but not great.  Not even \"really good\" either.\n\n- Hamachi ceviche -- as other reviews have mentioned they are not traditional ceviches. They're more like sashimi slices laying on a streak of citrus sauce. Hardly enough citrus to 'cook' the hamachi. It didn't taste all that fresh and lacked flavor.\n\n- Short ribs -- one large short rib in a deep pool of guava glaze. The meat was very tender but didn't have much depth in flavor. A few more spices would have given it some kick and made this a great dish, but the meat all on its own was a little dull.\n\n- Piggy back dates -- It seems like every tapas\/bocadillos place HAS to have bacon wrapped dates. I guess I should be glad that this place did, because it was the best dish of the night. Great textures (although the amount of goat cheese mousse was overkill) and great flavors.\n\n- Beef empanadas -- the outside of the empanadas was flaky and a little crispy. The inside could have used more beef. Almost every bite was pastry with a hint of beef. The beef tasted pretty good, I just wanted more of it.\n\n- Crispy shrimp -- decent flavor, not as crispy as I would have liked.\n\n- Sangria -- while it did taste good, it wasn't strong enough and was too sweet. It wasn't what I was expecting.\n\nWe sat at the bar on a Saturday night and didn't have any trouble finding seats. The service was very good. Our bartender was on top of things and we didn't have to wait long for drinks or food even though he and the other bartenders were very busy (all those mojitos take a while to make). Our bill came out to about $88 including tip for two people... not bad. However, I doubt I'll be back for the food. Caña might be a cool\/chill place for happy hour but there are better places around town for tapas. I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could, but 'm rounding up.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

We've lived in Vegas for a year and this was the worst food for the price we've had so far. We ordered the scallop ceviche, chicken flat bread, bacon wrapped dates, salad, and meatballs. The scallops were chewy and fishy and the ceviche's ingredients had a bad mixture of texture. The chicken flat bread was sparse. The salad was served the same way as coleslaw and bacon wrapped dates were greasy (goat cheese sauce tasted like sour cream). The meatballs dish was the only dish that we liked. I also ordered a glass of wine and it looked like it was two ounces. Our meal ended up being $74 and we were beyond disappointed.

We ordered cocktails and our food, we ordered their Meatballs, Spring Rolls, Mac & Cheese, and the Dates. We ordered these because they're are favorites from Firefly so we could compare. And we thusly found out there was no comparison. Cana's offerings were ok, but nothing outstanding.

The drinks are consistent, the food is so fresh and flavorful..each and every time!  The weather is warming up so we are definitely looking forward to some warm nights on the patio.  They have a little lounge patio area with a few cushy seats that almost seems like my own private little living room.  Perfect!\n\nThis visit Cory (owner) stopped by the table and he gave us some previews of drinks he is creating for the summer menu. (Which by the way is a selling point to this ADHD foodie...new stuff on the menu is a big plus)  I can't talk too much about the spicy, savory, tasty drinks we tried but let's just say one of them bit me!  There is also a new Sangria on the menu which is so refreshing and not too sweet.  Made with a Malbec and citrus juices (and Bacardi O) it is going to be the perfect complement to a warm Vegas breeze, swaying palm trees and ceviche.  \n\nSpeaking of ceviche we tried the Mushroom Ceviche.  I think it was made with Beech Mushrooms.  Those were new for me.  They were soaking in a citrus marinade that made raw mushrooms absolutely tasty.  We also had the Spicy Tuna Ceviche and the Mixto made with shrimp, scallops, and calamari (they have an 'choose 3' offer that we couldn't resist).  The 3 of those along with the Hamachi was almost enough for us.  \n\nBut even before the ceviches were ordered I could smell the aroma of truffle coming from the table next to us (and NO I am not sick of truffles yet)...so what did we have to try? The new Truffle Chips.  Um, HELLO, I need a whole bag of those right now!  Thin crispy waffle cut potato chips with grated parmesan and truffle oil.  You know how some of us like the really brown potato chips and pick them out of the bags? Well, these chips were like those on steroids.  I think I ate them all, but sorry, my eyes were closed and I was in Heaven so I don't really remember.\n\nThings to try: the Watermelon Ginger Margharita, the new Sangria, and the freakin' awesome Truffle Chips!\n\nAnd thanks Cory and GM (Ben I think?) for making our visit so entertaining, educational and above all...FUN!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I definitely wouldn't write it off though.\n\nOur cocktails were the highlight; my father had Fire Water which was a really unique concoction that included Ctristal Aguardiente, a Columbian liquor. The Diablo Dulce was exactly that, spicy and sweet- and utterly satisfying. The Sugarcane sangria was really good, and really sweet; I asked our waitress and from her description of its ingredients, -maybe it should be called High Fructose Corn Syrup Sangria.

My preliminary explanation is that people love sugar cane in their drinks; they love it so much that they are driven in a sugar frenzy to giving 4 or more stars. I can respect this. I didn't have any sugar cane drinks. I had a glass of wine and some food.\n\nThe atmosphere is dark and sexy and suave, and I do love a good atmosphere, but at Cana you pay for the atmosphere. The food was expensive for tapas. We had a ceviche, which was decent. I had no real complaints there, but some of my friends did not think it was the freshest. Then we had an $11 chicken flatbread. For $11, I expected some mega-chicken and assorted toppings, but there were maybe 9 little cubes of chicken and close to no mango that was promised on the menu. Not cool. The yucca frites were not too special, and the \"crispy\" $12 shrimp were not crispy at all. They were a bit soggy. Plus, most everything came to the table not hot. I hate not hot tapas.  \n\nI am willing to grant that perhaps I came on an off night. There was a manager type who appeared to be running dishes, when generally that is a task reserved for the waitstaff.

They need some sort of sign of life out front. We went here on a week night thinking it was Happy Hour menu. There were 3 of us. We ordered a ton of food wanting to try it all. And thinking Happy hour pricing. The server was training someone. You could tell they had both been drinking already. There were 3 tables in the restaurant and it was freezing in there. I wore my winter coat through the whole meal and still my teeth were chattering. The dynamic duo weren't sure if the the Beef Tenderloin Tiradito was available. We ordered Ceviche, tuna, dates, sliders, and short ribs, plus the beef tenderloin which we did not know if it was coming or not until it arrived. Usually tapas comes a few things at a time. Here it took forever and then BAM, it was all on the table. I have to say everything was delicious. I refused to share the beef tenderloin. The Sangria was very good too. After we ate we couldn't take anything as it doesn't travel well. So, don't overorder. The check came and we were surprised at the amount. My daughter had just been there the week before and they had Happy hour pricing at the time we were there. We asked the waitress what was going on with the check. She gave a long winded story about new specials and hours for Christmas shoppers. And went on forever, about lunch specials. Finally, we think she said they had changed the Happy Hours and we had missed it by 5 minutes. I know, we should have asked. But it is also good customer service to say \"sorry you just missed Happy Hour\". Especially since it changed from the previous week. We would have ordered the same anyway. It's the point that of all the 1000's of places in Vegas, we went there for food and Happy Hour. I am undecided if I will return. The service is the lowest. But the food is really good.

It is about the food!  If you make great food then people will come.\n\nI am a sucker for trying every new place around, despite the countless bad reviews I read.  Cabo''s was the latest of the new places I've tried.  Was the food horrible?  No, the food was not horrible.  Was the restaurant dirty?  No, the restaurant was actually very clean and nicely decorated..  Was the service bad?  No, the service was ok.  \n\nIf nothing was horrible then why the two stars?  There are countless Mexican establishments in Champaign\/Urbana and I've eaten at every one of them.  I would go eat at any of the good ones before going back here. The menu didn't contain 200 items like many of the other establishments, which I found kind of refreshing.  However, the prices were crazy high for Mexican food.  They charge $13.00 for a Fajita and $3.00 more if you want meat such as chicken or steak on it.  That is $16 for a Fajita that would be $9-$12 everywhere else.  \n\nThe food was not horrible, but it was bland.  The fajitas lacked flavor.  I had to salt and pepper it to make it taste like something.  When have you ever had to add salt and pepper to a Mexican dish after it has been served?  If the answer is more than zero then you've likely eaten at Cabo's or another bad Mexican restaurant. \n\nThe service consisted of countless college aged students of European decent.  I scanned the staff and didn't see one person that appeared to come from a Mexican background.   This is usually a worrisome sign for me at any ethnic restaurant, particularly at a Mexican restaurant.  This place could be Mexican-American owned and operated, but I doubt it.  The employees I encountered were pleasant, but the experience was nothing special.  Before you bash me as some white hating individual I must disclose that I'm white.  I also believe that my fellow fair skinned man can cook good ethnic food, but rarely is it ever as good as a person from that particular ethnic background (in this case Mexican). \n\nWith all the other Mexican establishments in town why would I eat here again?

John, the general manager, was professional and very friendly upon my initial inquiry and throughout the meal. My group ate in the small area to the right just inside the main door.\n\nThe service? It could not have been better. Angela and Joy spoke with me prior to the arrival of the other guests to make sure that everything was set up properly and to make sure that the guests would get the best possible service. They did a great job of getting drinks and food orders, offering suggestions, and generally having fun with the diners. Chips and drinks were refilled quickly and all the service was with a smile.\n\nEveryone enjoyed their meal. We ordered quite an array of entrees from tacos to fajitas. My meal, the stuffed poblano pepper, was excellent. Angela suggested adding spicy pork to it, but I was determined to have a meat-free meal today. The next time I will definitely try her suggestion. I thought the queso we ordered for our chips was outstanding. People gobbled up the fresh guacamole, which I personally thought needed just a bit more heat. The other suggestion one person made was that his meal also could have used a bit more heat. Needless to say, everyone left quite full and satisfied.\n\nAfter lunch, a few of us relaxed at the bar, making for a great ending to a wonderful experience. Great food, great service and reasonable prices: quite a combination for a Mexican restaurant on the southwest side of Champaign.

It was great while it lasted.***\n\nWe stopped in for an early dinner. We left filled and satisfied.  The food was very good and we will definitely be back. We had cheese curds as an appetizer. They were tasty, but they are breaded and then deep fried and served with a sauce. The sauce was a wonderful tomato-jalapeno-fruit sauce (can't fully identify the fruit), and it may have some roasted red pepper.  Truly good sauce.  The curds themselves were unexceptional. Too much breading, but that seems common in this part of the country.  (We prefer curds warm and \"naked\" with a spice \"rub\" rather than a sauce. But I'm not complaining. They were good.)\n\nThe main courses likewise were really good. The pork tacos had ample seasoned pork, cilantro, onions, and (oddly) sour cream. But the mix of flavors was very good, and I added the green salsa (that came with the chips) to mine.  The squash tacos were a real surprise, especially at a restaurant like this. They were spicy and perfectly done. Both taco dishes came three to a plate on soft corn tortillas.  The crisp was billed as a Mexican pizza-- a flour tortilla filled with cheese and toppings. Not quite a tostada, so Mexican pizza is probably as good a description as any.  It was piled high and easily shared. And, most important, it was delicious.\n\nThe chips and salsa were good. The salsa, in fact, was very good. Especially the hot salsa. It was a tomatillo salsa but with lots of peppers but still not really hot.  The red salsa was billed as mild, and it was. None in our party found it exceptional.  The chips were warm and very salty. I couldn't tell for certain, but I don't believe they are made on the premises.  \n\nThe menu is relatively large and broad, ranging from tilapia to steak to tacos and burritos. And there are many choices in each category. Carnivores and vegetarians both will find things on the menu, though vegan vegetarians may not find much.  It isn't really Mexican; if you are looking for authentic Mexican you should go to Maize or El Charro. The food here is Mexican Inspired. I'm not knocking it. It is delicious. The steaks and seafood with Mexican spices were amazing, and they have a greater variety of tacos than do the more authentic places. The chefs may have worked in a steakhouse as they really know how to cook the steaks.  And the spices and sauces add to the flavors rather than smothering or overwhelming the meats or vegetables. \n\nThe place has one other feature that many of our Mexican style restaurants lack: a lovely decor. Although says Cantina and Grill on the sign, this is a sit-down restaurant if you want it to be.  On the side away from the bar it has normal tables, while the bar area has service at the bar and at those \"tall tables\" that require high chairs to sit at.  The decor is simple but very nice, the music was quite low and we could easily talk over it.  There are several TVs and I suspect it serves as a nice sports bar on game days.  \n\nThe wait staff was wonderful. They would explain any dish you might have questions about, and they make recommendations if you give them guidelines about what you are looking for in a meal.  Very professional and amazing given that they've only been open for a week.  \n\nParking is ample and we were seated immediately. The waitress took our drink order less than five minutes after we were seated, and the drinks arrived promptly, as did the chips and salsa, and both were refilled quickly and without our needing to ask.\n\nAll in all, I think this place is off to a great start in Champaign! I suspect it will become one of our regular stops.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

That has been the best salad I have ever had. But I have to say, that the winner of it all for me at least is the sauce that came with the cheese curds. I am calling it the \"Magic Sauce\". I hope the owners would start bottling that sauce and having it for sale. I would definitely stock my pantry up with it. \nWhat I liked most is the variety they had. I even had a fabulous burger that was mildly spiced and had a cumin type flavor to it. Unfortunately for me, it was lunch time and since I had to go back to work, I did not have a cocktail.

The bartender has to come wait on us because the rest of the staff just stood around talking.  Overall the service wasn't that great.  We were then brought two kinds of salsa that we were told were made \"in house so they are extra yummy.\"  The salsa had no flavor.  Was very unimpressed and disappointed.\n\nThey have no lunch menu.  Everything is one price\/one size.  This was disappointing.\n\nI ordered the chicken burrito.  My co-worker had ordered the spicy pork burrito, and the third person decided not to eat because she was so put off by the who situation.\n\nThe burrito came out and looked good, but boy was I wrong.  They use black beans, which tasted like they were from a can and not washed off.  They tasted like they had been sitting in some sort of brine solution.  There was rice, which had no flavor either.  The rice they serve seemed a bit over cooked, had corn in it, and was very bland.  Basically they take a couple tortillas, spread some cheese on it, then rice, beans lettuce and the chicken.  They then \"grill\" it.  The lettuce was wilted and soggy.  Gross.  I cut the whole thing in half to eat the chicken.  It was the best part, but that's not saying much.  The chicken was salty...VERY SALTY.  I took the rest home thinking that I might be able to salvage it or give a bit to my dog, but it smelled so incredibly bad that I just threw the whole thing out at home.

You get your food in seconds, but it's pretty much just the same ingredients shuffled around in different combinations, and each component is not all that great. Not BAD, but not great. I think this is the first truly great place for Mexican I've eaten at in Champaign, which is why I'm throwing caution to the wind and actually giving it a full five stars.\n\nI just started going a few weeks ago, and I've been there three times since. I've always found the wait staff to be really pleasant. They do get pretty busy during dinner, but I've never had a terrible wait and usually get seated right away. It might help that I tend to eat dinner a little earlier, if possible.\n\nYou get chips and salsa, of course, to start at no charge. Their chips were fresh and light and warm. Nothing is a bad sign like bad tortilla chips at a Mexican restaurant. I have tried the guacamole and the queso. Of the two, I preferred the queso as an add-on dip for the Nachos. The guacamole was okay, but it could have used more lime, and I prefer my guac a bit chunkier.\n\nPossibly the best thing on their menu are their crisps, which are like little mini-pizzas on a tortilla-based \"crust.\" The crust of them is perfect. Delicate and flaky and crispy, which you'd hope based on the name. I've had bites of two different crisps-the pork and the red pepper varieties. I preferred the pork overall, but both were full of flavor. Their cheese and sauces seem of a very good quality and are very flavorful.\n\nI've also tried their pork tacos. The tortillas uses for their tacos (white corn, I believe) are great. Soft, with a little bit of texture and tooth to them. I did think their pork could used a tad more heat, but other than that they made a good lunch portion with the chips.\n\nDesert-wise, you must try their fried ice-cream! It's the best I've ever had. It seems like a hard thing to mess up too badly, but plenty of Mexican places that bother to offer it, do. It has a sweet, flaky crust and delicious chocolate drizzle. It might be nice if you got two coated, smaller scoops of ice cream instead of one larger one, just to balance out the crust and ice cream proportions a bit better. Still, it's delicious.\n\nAs far as drinks go, I have had two of their Margaritas. The first was a Blackberry and Basic concoction, and was my favorite of the two. I didn't get a ton of basil from it, but there was enough there to make it interesting. The other was a pineapple and coconut Margarita. This had a great taste, though I didn't get much coconut from it other than the toasted coconut on the rim of the glass. Neither skimped on the alcohol.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I consider myself having a pretty normal diet. The guacamole was salty. Black beans couldn't even taste beans because it was sooo salty. Rice was mushy and had no flavor at all. I tried my husband's chicken burrito, and it was salt with chicken essence. We wouldn't even bag it up for our dogs to eat. I had the cheese enchiladas. HORRIBLE. It was like a really bad quesadilla with some red sauce on it. No use of Mexican cheeses-- just really shitty kraft cheese that my knife wouldn't even cut through. \n\nService: Meh. Had to ask the bartenders for menus as no one was coming to our table. Server was new and didn't know the menu when we had a couple questions.

I was a server for 5 years and you just know when something isn't right with your customers. \n\nDrinks: Meh. I had the blackberry margarita, which tasted of only blackberry syrup. Needed to be cut with fresh lime juice. \n\nWe left with both of us wanting to throw up and head to the sauna to sweat out the salt. Seriously eating bad Chinese food and a bunch of sunflower seeds would still be less salt than this place. \n\nBasically if you like suburb quality Mexican food that uses frozen and not fresh ingredients come here.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

They don't actually have 24hr reception there though, but they leave instructions in front of the door so you can get in the house any time of the day.  \n\nThe hostel was located right in the heart of the Old Port of Montreal, where most of the tourist attractions there. The Old Port is a gorgeous place to wander about at night. \n\nOne bad thing is that the Internet was extremely slow when I was there (and it didn't work half the time), but this is something they may have fixed since then. There is also a pretty decent coffee shop down the road with Internet, so it's really not a big deal.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

The room was surprisingly nice, with windows looking out front. It was just under $80 for the two of us to have a private room. Given that this was my first hostel experience, I was quite pleased and made me think again about my thoughts on hostels.\n\nThe only somewhat negative thing I have to say is that because it's an old building, the windows aren't insulated and you can hear everything going on outside on the street, and also it gets a little chilly in the room. And the walls are thin and you can also hear everyone else in their rooms\/common area, so if you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs.

We all three ordered the meal which consisted of a slice of pizza, a delicious side, and a drink. In my case, I got a pepperoni pizza, toasted mini potatoes, and a Pepsi. I should mention that they had like 5 different kids of pizza ready to serve up (pepperoni, ham\/pineapple, cheese, sausage, jalapeno, stuffed...) which they warm up for you really quickly before serving it. As for the quality of my pizza? It was good. It was nothing to write home about, but it was good. I think the crust was kinda bland, but otherwise I was happy with it. The little potatoes they served me were pretty good, too. My friends ordered the pasta on the side, and they were happy with their food selections as well. As a matter of fact, they were happy enough with their sides that they ate them before the pizza and said it was a 5-star meal, though I was erring on the side of 3.

I think it's an enormous rip off, and I do not shop here for my usual grocery hauls. However, this Giant Eagle is right by my house, so whenever I need to run to the store for a random item or two (usually 2-4x per month), this is where I go. \n\nThis Giant Eagle is very clean, well stocked, and has a very good selection. Their bakery, sushi, already prepared foods (like rotisserie chickens), salad bar, and wine selection are really nice. They also offer a lot of items that I have a hard time finding at other stores (a certain yogurt, bread, etc.) \n\nThe employees at this location are split about 50\/50. Half are nice and\/or competent, and the other half are either rude and\/or don't know what they are doing. For example, I was in there one day in the 12 items or less line, and this lady was trying to buy individual clementines. The cashier said they didn't sell individual clementines and wondered where she got them. Two other employees were also there (one was checking out, and another was from the self checkout area), and no one knew where these clementines were from. So theyre just holding up the already long line trying to figure it out when I informed them that they're the free ones that are for kids while parents are shopping. I hardly even come here and I knew that, lol. Really? Three employees had no clue? \n\nAnother time I called to place a cake order, and apparently it was a real inconvenience to the bakery lady who was super rude evvvery step of the process. But whatever, the white cake with the satin (whipped) frosting from GE is so delicious that I'm willing to put up with rude employees to get it. \n\nBut, I'll still give this location 4 stars because it's not a bad store, it's clean, and they're always stocked. The prices are a rip off, and they could use more cashiers, especially during busy times- but what grocery store doesn't have that problem. The parking also sucks because all of the people are whipping in and out of the parking lot in their luxury vehicles going to and from Crocker Park, Giant Eagle, and all the other shops in the vicinity, but if you like to live on the edge, it's not too big of a deal.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

On the plus side, it is larger than many of the other Giant Eagles and, since it has more space, offers a better selection of many items than you get at the smaller stores.  It also carries more of certain items like prepared foods, sushi, wine, candy by the pound, and bakery than the Giant Eagles closer to Cleveland - I'm guessing this is due to its location in a more affluent suburb where people are more likely to spend on these products.  It also has more floor space devoted to seasonal items such as local sports memorabilia and (at Christmas time) Christmas ornaments, so I have found some interesting things to buy other than food here. \n\nOn the minus side, the store layout is not very user-friendly.  Upon entering the store you have to navigate the large bakery, prepared food, wine and seasonal sections before you even get to the food.  I realize this is to encourage you to spend on these items but if you go in specifically to get a can of beans or a package of meat, it's a pain having to walk about a half mile just to get to standard food items.  The food aisles also don't go all the way through the store front to back.  Instead the aisle is divided in half by another aisle and different products are placed on the two halves of the aisle.  This has made it very hard for me to find things several times.   The store also seems to have way too much useless junk for sale, such as cheap children's toys and books.  Finally, this store always seems to have uniformed security guards hanging around prominently, making me wonder what is going on at this location to make that necessary, as I go to several Giant Eagles located closer to Cleveland and do not see this kind of \"security presence\" at any of them unless the police have been specifically called to deal with some incident.  Since Westlake does not seem like a high crime area (in fact the opposite) I have to wonder why 1-2 uniformed security men are needed at this particular store.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Its quite a large, sprawling bar which is nice enough. As the name suggests it is an Irish bar and popular with the many Irish in Edinburgh.  Its located on a side street off the Grassmarket, I probably couldn't find it sober to be honest. I like the quirky little barrels for tables and such like.\n\nMy poor friend and I had been in a cheap little bar on the Cowgate where it was a pound a drink (my round, score!). Then we came in here and it was his round, unlucky for him. Vodka and coke and JD and coke came to just over £6. Poor guy was in shock! So a little expensive. But its quite fun and it has a good atmosphere with friendly bar staff. For future reference they do a student night on Wednesday, so go then for the cheap drinks!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

It is to be found at the end of a side road just after the end of the bridge above your head.  This entry road alone conjures up a spectacular atmosphere - it's almost like the movies where the best clubs are down some shady side street.  This street itself is perfectly safe, but it does do its job in creating a fabulous mood - all it lacks is a haze of mist for you to navigate through on your way to the door.\n\nOnce inside the first thing you'll notice is a vast amount of sporting memorabilia - mostly Irish with a few exception such as a Sunderland shirt above the bar - perhaps donated by Anthony Stokes, but who knows how this shirt came to end up in this collection.  Thanks to its location this pub has managed to maintain a high proportion of Irish patrons and the atmosphere remains distinctly Irish.  Add to this the occasional live music and along with Malones you have one of the best Irish pubs in Edinburgh.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

They have a good set up, with lots of open space, some huge booths and a stage at the far end. The interior is under George IV bridge so has a cool underground feel to it. As well as this they always have good bands on, nothing too original, all kinda Irishy \/ Folk \/ Rock covers but they are good fun, either to chill out to and have a chat, or to have a shimmy when it gets a bit more upbeat. Make sure to get there early (about half 12 \/ 1ish) because although it is pretty dead then, it gets full unbelievably quickly.\n\nFrom an Irish bar you expect slightly overpriced drinks, Dropkicks is really bad. Expect to pay almost £4 a pint, and they are pretty average, including the Guinness which is not as good as you'd expect. Spirits and mixers are pricey too, and whilst I haven't had the wine, I would be surprised if that bucked the trend. \n\nApart from that it's a good place to go for a night out, or after other bars have kicked out (it's open until 3) especially if you fancy a bit of live music.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Pretty much the kind of thing I like. There's a certain charm to getting stuck to the dance floor because the layer of alcohol beneath your feet is as thick as tar. There are often live bands playing at the weekend as well, which is good craic.  \n\nEveryone that comes here is always up for fun times and there's not a hint of pretentiousness about it, so you can make very little effort with your appearance, and no one will really care. But that could be because they've had too much Guinness and aren't able to distinguish who their friends are, let alone whether some random person has bothered to put mascara on or not.\n\nWhat haunts me whenever I come here is Dropkick Murphy's previous life as a bar\/club called Berties. They were some of the best days of my young life, I mean seriously good days, and I can't help but feel wistful whenever I'm here when I think about the Wednesday nights when all drinks were 50p, and sweat ran down the cave like walls. Happy times. Now the decor has been brightened up, but the stairs down to the toilets are still lethal, so if you've had a few, or you're wearing giant stilettos, creep down carefully, or you could end up in an embarrassing and no doubt painful tumbling situation.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

As you would expect the walls are covered in Irish icons; rugby shirts, road signs and Guinness adverts and the staff are largely Irish. It has a small dance floor, however Dropkick's is not a night-club. It is spacious, with most of the room taken up by 4 or 5 large booths with a big table and seats. Since these are large tables it is common to share them with other patrons, which depending on your view of meeting people, can be a curse or a blessing. \nThe drinks are typically priced for the centre of Edinburgh, with a pint of lager costing around £3. However, the main advantage to Dropkick's is that you can still be served up until around 3am, which means that if you are kicked out of another bar and do not feel ready for bed, or in the mood for a club, you can still have a drink in Dropkick's. In saying that, the music can sometimes be too loud for a conversation with anyone but the person sitting next to you. Also, on the weekend there is a door charge of around £2 after 11 or 12pm. Still, worth it for the craic.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

But the second trip -- had the fried cod dinner again, and there was something N-O-T Q-U-I-T-E R-I-G-H-T about it, tartar sauce wasn't even fully mixed, in place of the corn I had mixed (ugh!) veggies, french fries almost soggy, rice pudding had a liberal dose of cinnamon but it was still thin and tasteless, owner too busy on a personal phone call to say hello.  The good news -- our server was excellent, the kitchen got orders out quickly again, the rest rooms still clean, the dining room still neat and orderly.  the lentil soup was still quite good.  Weren't there for breakfast, but their breakfast menu looks good, with eggs, omelettes, waffles, skillets, etc.   Go east or west on Route 82 for some better options.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Well, not a good decision.\n\nAfter reviewing the menu I decided to try something 'safe' so I ordered the meat loaf with mashed potatoes and gravy.  The meat loaf had very little seasoning, if any.  It had an odd taste.  It also appeared to be overcooked around the edges.  There was quite a 'crust' on it.  Overall, not appetizing at all.  The 'mashed' potatoes were quite lumpy.  I had to finish mashing them with the fork.  It appeared they had been mashed quickly, possibly just before they were served.  Again, lack of seasoning, particularly salt.  Not good at all.   I didn't finish either item.\n\nAnd when I tried to pay my check, there was no one at the register.  I probably stood there about 3 minutes before another customer got in line behind me.  She finally summoned a waiter and asked if we could pay our bills.  The response was, \"I don't know where she is.\"  He then disappeared for a moment and then returned and said \"She will be with you in a minute.\"   Not good customer service.\n\nThe whole meal was not very good.  While the price was reasonable, the food didn't live up to the hype that I received.  I don't think I would either recommend this place or go there again.  There are better places with food that is more appetizing.   A real disappointment for sure.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I asked for a booth. I was seated and the server, asked, what can i get you to drink. I ordered my drink and the server left. As I am drinking my pop, the server finally brings me the menu and leaves again. As I am looking at the menu I noticed there were family members of the owner\/manager (maybe), helping out in which I thought was cute? But kind of weird! I thought that it was sweet that a family business was helped by togetherness of family members. As I am waiting for the server to return  to take my order I noticed that some of the tables were dirty and the floor was sticky. It seemed  that the tables were not properly wiped off. The server finally came back to take my order, i ordered the corn beef and fries instead of cabbage  and a salad with oil and vinegar then hums as an appetizer. I sat and waited for my order for about 15-20 minutes. The owner\/manager was walking around helping out his family members. That's a good owner\/manager helping out. The server brought out the salad with the dressings. I notice that the dressing  bottle was very dirty, The rest of the food came out all at once instead of the appetizer first. The hummus did not taste like hummus. The hummus was very tasteless. The corn beef was bland and the carrots tasted like  they came from a can from the store. The fries tasted as if they were prefrozened  and prepared from a bag instead of fresh.

She kept coming over and rushing us to make a decision.  When I say rushing I mean like every minute or so.   Seriously. \n\nThe Chicken Noodle Soup looked like glorified boxed soup.  The salad had lettuce that was starting to rust.  Someone must really like onions because there were 7 large slices of red onion on it.  But, here is the best part was the dressing came in a squeeze package like the ones at fast food places.  The meatloaf was horrible but strangely the mashed potatoes were good.  The fried chicken was OK. They make it with honey so chicken is very sweet and not something I'd eat again.  The fries were typical frozen french fries but were OK.  \n\nIf the food wasn't disappointing enough, all of the servers had bad attitudes and it showed.  We could hear all the talk from the kitchen since we were so close.  It is obvious no one wants to be there.  They don't care about the quality of their food or service.

All it took was the words \"Churrasqueira\" on the sign to convince me to step inside and abandon my plans of going to the gym. I'd never heard of a Churrasqueira before, but it sounded kinda like \"Carniceria,\" which always means good food.\n\nI parked my bike in front of a be-toqued hobo and crossed the threshold. This place is the real deal. Boisterous olive skinned people (the Portugese?) conversed loudly with each other across piles of chicken and glasses of red wine. A baba-from-the-old-country-looking lady sat in a corner, monologuing to a group men standing around in jackets and scarves. Everyone seemed like they belonged here, like they either worked for the place or were related to someone who did. Some hilarious over-the-top foreign soap opera played in the corner, unwatched.\n\nAbout the time when I was starting to feel out of place, this sweet girl behind the counter grabbed my attention and set me at ease with a good old \"hi there, let me know if you have any questions!\" I ended up ordering the half chicken special, the words leaving my mouth slow and gummy due to the fact that my lips were still frozen. I'd hoped I made a good first impression, because this girl became my rock. Within two minutes of stepping into this place I felt like I had been dropped into another country and I was gonna need a friend.\n\nInitially, I had planned to grab the food and go, but the ambience was so pleasant that I decided to stay, even if that meant eating dinner in a restaurant by myself while being scrutinized by locals. I pulled out this new neuroscience book that I'd been hoping to read and got to work on it; waitress girl brought out some bread and butter. Ahhhh yeaa, I was gonna make of night of this.\n\nBefore I knew it, the chicken dinner arrived. The thing was huge, one of those classic big Italian dinner plates piled high with salad, spherical potatoes, chicken, and dipping sauce. It was truly the biggest pile of food I'd ever seen at a restaurant in Toronto.\n\nThe chicken was fantastic. Rubbed with salt and some interesting combination of spices. It was totally worth breaking this week-long vegetarian streak I'd been on. The potatos, too, were remarkable: salty, roasty, and inherently satisfying. However, the best part of the dish was the piri piri sauce. This stuff (which waitress girl later informed me was handmade made in house), had the perfect balance of heat, acidity, and flavor. It also had a fair bit of creaminess that really rounded out the flavor of the potatoes.\n\nAll too soon, the chicken was gone and I was stuffed. I felt truly good. Not even the thought of having to bike through the snow could put a damper on my chicken-fortified spirit. I'd had a good meal, made some progress on this book, and found a cool new place to eat where I felt welcome. I think the waitress even called me cute at the end there. Ahh yeaa.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}
