Over the last couple years however, we had a family pass to the YMCA just a few blocks over. Since we could put my son in swimming lessons there for no extra cost, we just went there. However, my son has a bit of apprehension in the water. He gained some skills in their lessons, but he was stagnating over time.\n\nWe've known a few people who enrolled their children at Making Waves, and one thing I knew right off the bat that would make them ideal is the max of 3-1 child to teacher ratio. I can't emphasize enough how important that is, as I watched my son at his previous lessons have to wait several minutes at a time for his turn when there were about 5 in his class.\n\nFrom what I've seen, the instruction is also at a high level. One example is previously my son was learning to float by having the teacher hold him under his shoulders and pull them along the water. Here, the teacher actually helps support him more under his lower body. It makes sense, as the upper body is where the body floats, with the lower body being prone to sink being only muscle and bone. This technique seems to give the student a better sense of learning how and then trusting their body to float. They also do a great job of helping push students just outside of their comfort zone. Enough to encourage learning, but not enough to scare them too much. For example, for some of the lessons you'll see the teachers count loudly to 5 as the student is doing their best to stay afloat when swimming,which seems seems a reasonable amount of time for them to push through, without worrying about being under too long.\n\nTerrific facility as well, with a huge viewing area to watch the lessons, a play area for kids who may be waiting, and a nice change area. A terrific thing about this place is that they use salt water as a natural cleanser\/disinfectant for the pool rather than chlorine. It improves the smell, but I'm sure it's better for skin too.\n\nIt is naturally more costly to attend here than most other places. I can't fault them for that given the details above; but I wish they'd offer the 10% discount for the second child rather than only if you have 3 attending. Many don't have 3 kids to begin with, and I think a 10% is still a fair deal if family have 2 children attending given the cost.\n\nIt is what it is, but ultimately, everything is at a high standard. One month of lessons in, my son has progressed at a rate that may have taken 6 elsewhere.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Es liegt am Rande des Stadtteils direkt an Wald und Wiesen des Ramsbachtals. Gestern (29.3.10) entschloss ich mich sponatan mit Begleitung das Restaurant aufzusuchen. Es liegt nur ca. 20 Gehminuten von S-Hoffeld entfernt. Das Gebäude gehört wohl irgendwie zum TSV Birkach der dort diverse Sport-stätten betreibt. Vermutlich war es mal die Vereinsgastätte. Überbleibsel finden sich in der teilweise übernommenen Inneneinrichtung wieder u.a. (hellbraune Holztische) \nEs gibt einen Tresen und ausreichende Sitzmöglichkeiten die den heutigen An-sprüchen angepasst wurden. Trotz allem blitzt das Sportlerheimambiente durch, dem sollte sich jeder Besucher bewusst sein. Zum Essen: Das Angebot (bis 1.4.10 nur Mo\/Di\/Do) versprach 200g frisches Filet-Steak mit Beilagensalat für 15 EUR pro Person ! Der (gemischte) Salat wurde vorab auf einem kleinen Teller mit Dressing serviert. \nEr überzeugte durch seine Frische, kein Billigkraut aus dem 10-Liter-Eimer, bis auf die Gurkenscheiben, die wohl schon länger aufgeschnitten rumlagen. Das Steak wurde kurz drauf aufgetischt. Garniert mit einem großen Salatblatt, ein kleines Stück Kräuterbutter und Danke der Küche eine Portion Kartoffelecken ;-) Das Steak war nicht ganz nach meinem Wunsch gebraten, was ich aber nicht reklamierte. Es war sehr schmackhaft, zart innen und aussen lecker kroß angebraten. Wirklich sehr gute Qualität. Fazit: Gutes Essen zu angemessenem Preis, sehr freundliche und nicht aufdringliche Bedienung.\nEin Besuch ist lohnenswert. Tipp: Bei der Platzwahl nicht in Tresennähe  mich haben die Sportler und ihre lauten Unterhaltungen genervt ;-) Schönberg rüstet auf !!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Its okay for a hot summer day but it wasn't like I am craving it or anything. Nothing like Frost in Tucson, although they do carry the flavor Striciatella. The chocolate with hazelnut was okay, except there were hardly any hazelnuts in it. The chocolate was okay too but there were no chocolate shavings in it either....It tastes more like regular ice cream than gelato, so don't know if I care for it that much. The place is hip and cool though. The scoops are way small than Frost size servings. The owner was there and apparently they make all their stuff right on site. I asked her if she had yogurt too and she said that sometimes they make it but its so hard to make so she tends to be lazy on that part. Nice people though.

The shaved ice is extremely fine!  There are over 30 flavors to choose from, and multiple flavors can be added into the same cup!  This place is extremely generous with the syrup quantity too.  Feel free to save the, \"We want more!  We want more!\" in this case!  \nMost of the flavors are on the sweet side, so if you're not a fan I suggest grabbing a sugar free flavor or a sour flavor (the word sour will be in the name).\n\nDon't forget to add the ice cream!  The only flavor offered is vanilla, but it is delicious and compliments most flavors (sour flavors not so much)!  The ice cream is very smooth and creamy.  \n\nBy the way, this little shack is located in a gas station's parking lot.  If you're planning to drive away immediately after receiving your order, I suggest asking for your choice of size served in a bigger cup.  For example, I normally have my medium serving placed in the cup meant for a large serving.  The cups normally have 2-3 inches of shaved ice stacked above the rim, so this is a good option for busy-bodies like myself.\n\nOne last note, the staff definitely deserves recognition.  Every worker that I've come across during my visits is always wearing a smile and has a goofy personality that can make anyone smile.  That can't be easy after being cooped up for hours!

Now that I finally have, I thought I'd review one of my favorite types of establishments -- a no-frills diner.\n\nMy mom, 2-year-old, and I dropped into John's on a Wednesday at 10:30. I was pleased at how quiet and drowsy it was inside, yet we still got greeted enthusiastically and the waitress tended to us right away. Something tells me that if we were to come in at the same time on a Saturday, it would have been packed, but we would have still been acknowledged and served in an efficient manner. It's just that type of place and seems to be run really smoothly.\n\nTwo things I was surprised about: their corned beef hash is, like, REAL. No crap out of a can (though I will always hold a special place in my heart for that salty gruel). It tasted great and came out fast. The second thing: they have a sign on the table boasting their own root beer made with cane sugar. I hate root beer, but that's pretty impressive.\n\n My daughter had a short stack of blueberry hotcakes and we had more than half left over because they were huge and hearty. My mom requested that her omelette be made with egg whites only, and they did that with no problem. \n\nThe coffee wasn't AMAZING, but it was better than average, hot, and the refills kept coming. Our waitress was attentive without being intrusive.\n\nPretty much a great diner experience that I'll be sure to repeat in the near future!","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

Too many restaurants slink around your ankles like beaten dogs, cravenly asking, \"Do you want anything, sir?  Please?  Yes, I can get it for you, restaurant-Gollum loves the master, we adoreses you...\"\n\nJohn's Diner will serve you, but on its own terms.  They treat you like people; they're happy to see you, but they've been around for fifty years and will be around for fifty more.  The waitresses tell you what's going on in the back, complain merrily about the job, bring your food to you, pat you on the shoulders.  They have that quiet pride that says, \"If you behave well, you're part of the family here.  If not, here's the door.\"  I didn't ask for anything special, but one suspects that if I asked them for, say, a pomegranate-infused soda, they'd look at me sternly and go, \"Now, what did you want THAT for?\"\n\nAs such, it's supremely pleasant atmosphere.  This is a classic DINER diner, a long narrow train tube with a row of stools for the quick eaters and beat-up booths in the back, where the scents waft out of the kitchen behind the counter.  \n\nThe food?  Well, as Gini notes, they put the greasy in greasy spoon, but that's actually part of the charm; they don't care about eating healthy, they want you to eat hearty.  They have all the greatest diner hits, from eggs and bacon to open-faced turkey sandwich, and the food is not exceptional but it is home-made and fills you up quite nicely on a low budget.\n\nWould I recommend this to my snooty foodie friends?  No.  But would I take them here the morning after a night out for comfort food?  You betcha.

There were items hand-written into the menu, the elderly waitress made a comment that the \"chef\" was new, and the register was brand new to the waitress as well. \n\nSo, anyhow, the story:\nTwo adults and one child (age of 5). Empty diner except one elderly gentleman who showed up while we were there. The establishment was dirty....don't care. I actually expected it and may have been disappointed had it not been. The waitress needs to retire. She seemed to be struggling stringing sentences together a little. Still, not a big deal. \n\nLet's order!\n\nSo the child of our bunch ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, the adults meals were roast beef and mashed potatoes and gravy as well as swedish meatballs over noodles. \n\nEach meal came with the soup of the day (a creamy spinach soup with whatever those noodles are in wedding soup). I ordered the chili on top of that just to have a taste. The chili was GROSS! Not like a gross like this is too sweet, or too salty, or just not a good recipe....it was GROSS in a way that can only be described as it seemed as though it was so old and re-used or SOMETHING that it developed a taste of nothing with the consistency of cream of wheat. \n\nThe soup of the day came out.....again.....GROSS!!!! Gross for the same reasons except this also had the added pleasure of tasting like they \"of the dayified\" the soup pot by adding a block of salt. VERY gross. I eat EVERYTHING no matter what. I dd NOT eat this.\n\nSpaghetti comes out. Giant portion for a kid but one can't complain about that. Sad-looking but no bog whoop. She enjoyed it.....she's 5. \n\nThe roast beef and mashed potatoes come out. Immediately I see those scooped, starchy, obviously flake potatoes.....no big whoop. Not my cup of tea but they can;t be that bad. The roast beef, however, looked (and I tasted it) and tasted HORRIBLE! It had a gray tinge to it, had the appearance of a texture closer to pencil shavings (only larger) and there was literally zero moisture left in it at all. Gross but let's press on.\n\nWhile that was going on, I heard the waitress speak to the \"chef\" and explained that the Swedish Meatballs over noodles uses egg noodles and not spaghetti noodles and moreover (she didn't use that word I assure you) the \"sauce\" is a brown gravy and not marinara sauce. There was some kind of muttering of acknowledgement and the waitress let me know that there was a problem and that my meal would be out shortly. \n\nThe \"chef\" tried to give me the exact same thing the child across from me had and call it \"Swedish Meatballs Over Noodles\"!!!! Wrap your brain around that! So, after a brief lapse, the plate comes out....unbeknownst to me half my plate had spilled onto the counter during transport and the waitress had used a couple spools to get it back onto my plate before giving it to me. MMMMMMMMM!!!!! Then I look down. It's the same meatballs sitting across from me, the same spaghetti noodles (not egg noodles) sitting across from me with the same brown gravy sitting across from me.....ok, I'm not a debutante...I'll tough it out. \n\nI sliced into the first meatball. I took a bite. It was nearly frozen in the center had a salty briny taste from the gravy that also seemed spoiled. It was gross. The very first time in my years I just pushed a plate away and refused to eat it. \n\nThe waitress came over shortly after and asked how everything was. I let her know that I will kindly pay for these meals but would not feed these things to a stray dog. I let her know this was the first time I ever said this dining out. \n\nShe asked if she could take something off the check? First off, the right thing to do is to just apologize and comp the meal....I wasn't about to debate what should be taken off, get into a mathematics quiz with someone who seems confused that she is even working at a restaurant (again, no offense but she just needs to stop). \nSo we all got up and walked toward the register. This is how we found out that the register is new......\nSo I was charged a little over 20 bucks. I handed the waitress 2-20s and asked if I could just have a 10 back. This was a problem. She could figure out how to open the drawer or use it in any way. She talked to it in disdain and was even starting to have that same kind of demeanor Kathy Bates had in Misery. Losing it to say the least. I felt bad at first but then she started to smack the register each time a button press was unsuccessful....kinda in a way when you first find out your girl is a little bit kinky but you aren't quite sure what that means.","useful":2,"funny":8,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

The level of response I received was in stark contrast to that suggested in the Warranties section of the Aktive8 website.\n\n\n Nearly four months later I had still not received a refund or replacement. I eventually received a refund, without an apology or explanation of the delay.\n\n\n Aktive8 has a telephone number (premium rate) that only answered by a recorded message stating 'all lines are busy'. If you call at midnight on Sunday you'll hear the same message. If you call on one phone and get the message, then call on another simultaneously, the second phone gets an engaged tone.\n\n\n Emails are read, but not responded to. I did receive a single email stating that 'there has been a delay'. No apology or explanation of why.\n\n\n Appalling customer services. I would AVOID at all costs. I'd personally recommend http:\/\/www.wiggle.co.uk - they have a tried and tested reputation and offer discounts too.\n\n\n It appears I'm not alone in this either. If you read the reviews at\nhttp:\/\/www.reviewcentre.com\/reviews173957.html \n\n\n If you need to contact Aktive8 don't use the costly 0871 231 8888 number it has the recorded all lines are busy message, so does 0131 228 5047. Use the shop number on 0131 228 3003. There's no guarantee that anyone will answer it took many days of trying before anyone answered.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I contacted Jennifer requesting package info and price quotes for hair and make up 1.5 weeks prior to my engagement photo session. She replied within 12 hours with a friendly email explaining what she had to offer. After reading an offer I couldn't refuse, I called her to ask any remaining questions, which she gladly answered and decided to ask her to send me a contract, which was sent promptly via email. She requested that I email her with my ideas of what \"look\" I wanted to achieve for my photos. She said that I could email\/text her pictures of my ideas and what I like. She also asked me to send a picture of myself so that she could ensure she'd have the right colors to match my skin tone. Once I emailed her with photos and information on what I wanted, she provided me with advice on how to prep myself for the day of the shoot.\n\n She gladly offered to come out to conduct our appointment at the hotel we were staying at on the strip. She arrived early...EARLY - about 6:45 AM for our 7 AM appointment. She set up in our bathroom and we got to work. She did mermaid curls for me and did airbrush makeup. She informed me that the makeup might look a bit heavier than what I had requested, as photo shoot make up needs to be a bit heavier. She ensured me that the right look would still come out in the photos. She was spot-on right. I did think the make-up looked heavy in person, but when I received my photos from the photographer, the make-up could not have been more perfect! Had it been any lighter, I may have been disappointed. I could not be any happier with the look that she helped me to achieve. It was very natural, but heavy enough so that my features would come out in the pictures. My curls stayed intact beyond our session, so I was able to have fun with them while walking around in Vegas.\n\n I cannot recommend Jennifer enough. She is experienced, friendly, and affordable.

So I ended up canceling my services with Muse for my wedding.  I had contracted their services almost a year ago for wedding hair and makeup.  At that point they had rave reviews on wedding wire and yelp.  However, things have taken a turn for the worst in 2014 by the company, as evidenced by the other reviews on this site.  Even from the get go, I had difficulty receiving an email with the contract.  Jennifer, the owner, attributed the delay the first time to problems with the email: info@museartistrylv.com.  Eventually, we sorted that out.  Email problems happen, so I figure no big deal.  Fast forward to my engagement hair and makeup, that went off without a hitch.  So there are the two stars from my experience from August 2013 (see my other review).  So fast forward, I'm a little over a month out from my wedding. I schedule my trial hair and makeup way in advance and even send an email confirming time and date.  My trial time is 11am...I just happen to check my email while waiting for them to show up for the trial.  In my inbox is an email, sent that morning, canceling for the day since one of the artists is ill. Okay, illness happens but as a professional company and owner you need to pick up the phone and call your client. An email is not an acceptable form of cancellation. So I pick up my phone and call to see if I can reschedule, no answer on her personal cell or the company phone number.  The best part is the voicemail that states leave your info and we will get back to you in 24 hours.  I also email both emails again asking for someone to call me regarding rescheduling.  Yeah...don't count on a response in 24 hours. Fast forward 4 days later, I again send another email and leave voicemails on both numbers requesting contact.  I decide at this point to send a text message with something along the lines of please let me know if I need to start looking elsewhere for hair and makeup services.  I finally get a text message stating that her phone had died and that she would make my next appointment a priority.  Okay, I get your phone died but you clearly still have access to email since you sent me one to cancel the morning of the trial.... I follow up by asking who the artists will be for the trial, it ended up not being the same two listed on my contract.  She did sound sincere, as sincere as you can be on text message regarding the cancellation.  But after I reviewed all my email correspondence with her, this is the second time she has had problems with her iPhone.  She may indeed have very poor luck with her phone....might I suggest a land line or one not routed to your cell phone. But at this point, I had a decision to make....do I worry about being stood up on my wedding day via email or do I find peace of mind and cancel. The choice was easy, I'll consider my deposit a donation and move on.  However, I did the responsible thing in this break up.  I did try to call to cancel, but surprise no one picked up.  I also emailed and texted just to be on the safe side.  She did respond to the text.  I will tell you that IF they show up you will probably get good value for services rendered, since I shopped around and they were the lowest priced packages.  But you know lesson learned, you get what you pay for...  Brides, make an educated decision.","useful":6,"funny":1,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

It would have been about two months ago, I used to live a stone's throw away from this location and whenever I was feeling particularly lazy, or lax about spending money I would shop here.  Employees were always friendly and whenever I needed a quick feta fix or a last minute bit of cilantro for for finishing my revered spicy Thai peanut sauce this was my spot.\n\nSo as I was saying before my ramble, I experienced the ultimate in \"feel good\" moments here a few short months back.  I was picking up some produce and must have been shaking my head visibly at the astronomical cost of everything, when I was approached by an aisle clerk who covertly pointed me in the direction of what appeared to be a shopping cart set aside.  I thought that my eyes had deceived me. This cart was brimming with produce!  Many of the items I had in my hands were in said cart and I was informed that they would be throwing them away, but that if I wanted they may be able to sell to me at a marked discount.  I jumped at this opportunity and was actually able to buy three times what I needed at half the price.  I made a vegetable heavy pasta salad, cous cous, and vegetable noodle soup, and was super happy that I was allowed to find a home for these soon to be discarded items.  Definitely a feel good moment for both my wallet and soul.\n\nI don't know if this act of charitable kindness was against store policy, and hope that I'm not getting someone who committed an admirable act in trouble with management, but something like this should be commended and not condemned.  This one gesture more than made up for all the over- priced items that I have bought at Sobey's over the years.

Sorry to be so open but i get brazillians and this place SUCKS. when i started i was kinda shopping around trying to find a place i liked and someone that made me comfortable.

I didnt do it again for a while until i found Donato's and found my lady. the only other 2 times i have gone here was because my lady was gone and this place was easy and convenient. After the last time I will NEVER EVER GO AGAIN. first off, if your an esthetician you should look like you take car of yourself because you are promoting your work. Its like going to a hair dresser and her hair is a nest of mess....would you want her to cut your hair? NOPE. Anyways this girl just was overly tanned with avatar make up and looked like she didnt take care of herself at all. this kind of put me off but i just figured whatever i will go with it. the room they put you in is cramped and is not very warm or comforting. You kinda feel like your in a box. The girl started doing her thing but she was horrible. she was not gentle (and believe me you can be gently during this process) and the wax was too hot. I had burns and bruises it was not fun. She layed wax over the same spots twice or three times to get 1 hair she could have plucked out. ANYONE who gets waxed from a professional knows you CAN NOT put hot wax over the same spot twice...it causes burns. I also used to work in a spa so i know these things. She was just not friendly to me at all and was so rough with me. I did not like this at all. But you get what you pay for, its cheap for a reason i guess. \n\nIn a situation like that i like being comfortable and relaxed and i was not.

It's only two strip malls away from my parents' hood (since I'm a visitor and didn't keep track of actual distances, and there are strip malls galore in this area, that's how I keep tabs on locations), and it's a Jewish-sounding deli! Sign me up...\n\nThree of us went for lunch and got sandwiches. My cousin, a 19-year-old macho man terrorizing much of the Phoenix female population currently, got the chicken salad sandwich. He liked it a lot. It was piled high with mayonnaisy (how in the heck should I spell that, sorry) looking chopped chicken. My boyfriend got the roast beef sandwich with cheese and roasted red peppers. He thought it was pretty good, but picked off the red peppers. I tried one, and could see why they wouldn't really fit with the rest -- really pungent tasting, would totally overwhelm and stand out from the other flavors. I got the half sandwich\/half salad combo with the thanksgiving turkey sandwich (cranberry spread, yum) on whole wheat, house salad. Eh, just ok. Nothing special. \n\nThis rates ok since it's convenient and serviceable, but really it's not the good Jewish deli I was hoping for, and the prices are pretty high for just a sandwich.

We became intimately familiar with it when we lived for nearly a year up in a  Grayhawk apartment, waiting for our condo renovation to be completed.  I love the egg dishes (try the Chicago omelet), the salads (Trifecta rocks), pastries made in-store (the black-and-whites are good, and the fat-free blueberry muffins are better than the regular ones--all are usually refrigerated, though, so you may want to ask for your muffin to be heated before serving) and the bagels have the perfect bite and chewiness (contrast with the bagel-shaped bread that Einstein's churns out).  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have found the owner's family to be quite friendly and quick to recognize regulars.\n\nSeating is sketchy during peak hours, although, for a relatively small strip-center establishment, there are a decent number of tables in and outside.  As a first-timer, remember to ask the wait staff at the door to give you a number corresponding with an open table.  You will need this when placing your order at the counter.

I was a little surprised when we got there, as I expected a sitdown restaurant, but instead it's an order at the counter and the food is brought out kind of place.  There was a TON of seating outside, and I remarked to my wife that Kashman's is probably the place to go on the weekend's once the temps cool down...\n\nWe each ordered a coffee and the wife ordered a egg\/cheddar bagelwich on an everything bagel, while I ordered the stuffed challah french toast.  There were several choices of Seattle's Best coffee at the self serve condiment bar, and I think three different types of milk.  Coffee was good.  After a few minutes the food was served to us.  My french toast (stuffed w\/ cream cheese and fried) was delicious.  It was one of the dishes where I have to tell my wife that if she wants a bite she better hurry up and get it while there is some to be had.  I finished the whole thing, no problem and wish the serving size had been a touch bigger.  The only downside of the plate was the fruit that came with it.  There was much honeydew and cantaloupe (both of which I dislike) and precious few slices of delicious strawberry.  I also had some of my wife's sandwich after she was done, and thought it was good, bagel was nice and warm still.  \n\nKashman's get a solid four stars, and I'd probably go more often if it was a little more convenient for me, though I have a couple of relatives who I would consider making the drive out here for.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

I found the \"art\" really tacky to be honest, but the cuisine is phenomenal.  I thought the menu lacked a little bit of creativity and selection, but the execution was perfect.  The fried chicken was absolutely perfect.  I would strongly recommend reservations for this place...they turn the tables over very slowly and it is a small restaurant.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}

Bridgette rocks.  She did our engagement pictures and they came out so good.  She convinced us to bring out 7 month old. We came back a week later and she was so patient with him. Especially since these were his first professional pictures since he was first born.  We received a great deal and we got our pictures archive for 2 years with the Target portrait card and free sitting fees. We will be back next month for family pictures. Check out Groupon before you purchase pictures.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":2,"type":"review"}

This studio called me twice to confirm and to make sure I get there early. My appointment was for 10. And I didn't get out of there till 11:30. The shoot itself took like 15 minutes.

Love starting my day here.  The shakes are yummy and can keep me going and the green tea with a touch of aloe mango, is great too.  \n\nThis is not a turnkey in and out place, because each shake is made individually to the 30 or more flavors they have, and along the way while waiting the neighborhood folks are nice, and hey, it's kind of nice to meet our neighbors with like minds once in awhile. \n\nThey are very upfront that they are Herbalife folks, no secrets it's all over the walls, but it is not a pitchy place.  You ask if you are interested, if not, come get a shake and meet your neighbor.  Highly recommend it.  I take all my friends visiting here.  \n\nNew owners, Jamie and Jay are great, (and we'll miss Clint & Nadine who were great too)  Good luck to the new owners, I think it's an awesome place.  \n\nMy only complaint, I'd love it if they were open later in the day or on Sundays.  But if that's the worst, you want them open longer...that's still okay.  Worth waking up to!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1,"type":"review"}

Like many people, I want to feel good, and not get depressed when I get dressed. Also, like many people, the whole concept of how to achieve this remains a mystery.  I do work out, but admit I get overwhelmed when I'm in a rush, need to eat, but don't have time to figure out if I am going to regret what I chose. But I think this place has the right idea of demystifying nutrition!\n\nThey have every flavor smoothie imaginable, (carrot cake, cookies and cream, chocolate, etc.) and they're 250 calories or less. I loved the carrot cake! It was delicious!  I also tried the peach aloe tea, and it was very refreshing. There are tables and chairs inside to hang out, *Free* bootcamp posters on the wall, (offering 3 classes a week outdoor at 56th st and Sweetwater) and everyone was so friendly! I will definitely be back soon!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"type":"review"}
